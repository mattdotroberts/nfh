It's become a huge part of my "mental health toolkit" during 2020, enabling me to deal with the many mental overloads that fatherhood puts on my plate each week.</p><p>I wanted to share one parenting hack I picked up through the app. It's from a series called "The Stoic Path", by William B Irvine. He suggests reframing things you're not enjoying with "The Last Time Meditation". And honestly, it couldn't be easier:</p><blockquote><p>"<em>When you’re doing something, you should reflect on the possibility that this might be the last time you do it. Again, you don’t dwell on this possibility, it’s just a flickering thought. Doing this can dramatically change your perspective on the events of your daily life. Mowing my lawn can be a burden, particularly on a hot day, but I can lighten that burden by remembering that there will be a last time that I am physically able to mow a lawn, and that after that time has passed, I will likely look back on these as the good old days."</em></p></blockquote><p>This works. I promise you. I did it last night. I was drying my daughter's hair. It's long. Very long. She's almost 7 and it's never seen a pair of scissors (apart from the few times that she's gotten a bobble / hair tie caught in it). She hates getting it dried—and I hate drying it too, because she complains, won't sit still, and gets frustrated with me as I attempt to comb out all the knots. We both end up annoyed with each other.</p><p>But last night? I stopped, and thought about the last time meditation. I realised that, very soon, she's going to be drying her own hair. And you know what? I'm really going to miss doing this.</p><p>In an instant, it changed my whole perspective on the situation.</p><p>I've done it a few times over the last month and it's been such a great exercise. Cycling back from school in the rain? I imagined it was the last time I'd feel raindrops hitting my face. Changing the nappy of my son? I realised (thankfully) that I won’t be doing this for much longer and, one day, I'll probably miss it.</p><p>I've even tried it when he wakes up at 4am in the morning—to see if it helps me feel happier about that.</p><p>But "The Last Time Meditation" isn't that good. Nothing is.</p><p><em>(BTW, I'm not at all involved in the app, and this isn't an ad. Just something I've found helpful, and I thought you might too.&nbsp;<a href="https://dynamic.wakingup.com/redeemMonth/fabb69">Here's a link for a free month if you're interested in trying it out</a>.

It feels too judgmental. Too uncomfortable. Maybe even too religious. But the blunt fact is that the nuclear family has been crumbling in slow motion for decades, and many of our other problems—with education, mental health, addiction, the quality of the labor force—stem from that crumbling."</em></p></li><li><p>One of the unfortunate side-effects of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/parenting-pandemic-decision-fatigue_l_60463e13c5b660a0f38a6b3c">parenting during a pandemic is "decision fatigue"</a>—the idea that after making many decisions, a person’s ability to make additional decisions becomes worse.&nbsp;<em>"It’s different from ordinary physical fatigue—you’re not consciously aware of being tired—but you’re low on mental energy. The more choices you make throughout the day, the harder each one becomes for your brain, and eventually it looks for shortcuts."</em></p></li><li><p>This&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/17/parenting/podcasts-for-big-kids.html">Big List of Podcasts for Bigger Kids</a>&nbsp;contains 30 podcasts for kids between 6-10 years old.

This newsletter continues to be free, thanks to the ongoing support of paid members who get access to regular events, private essays, and a supportive community of like-minded dads. </p><p>Here’s what a few have said about life on <a href="http://thenewfatherhood.org/subscribe">the other side of the paywall</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“For a bunch of guys I’ve never met I’ve come to value your opinion an awful lot, far more than some of my friends to be honest”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“I'm nearly 9 weeks into fatherhood, and this week I've come to the realisation that I do genuinely love being a dad. That's in no small part due to this community, Kevin's emails and the recommendations of media and content that you guys provide. I just wanted to drop a quick note to say thanks to all of you. 🙂”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“The TNF community on Geneva is a treasure trove of resources, a group of active listeners, and a place to talk through some of fatherhood’s most challenging moments.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“I never knew I needed a community of dads until I found The New Fatherhood. It’s made me feel that I’m not alone in the everyday titanic struggle of raising little Homo sapiens, and it’s giving me the tools to be a better dad for the next generation.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“As a new dad adult conversations can be hard to come by, let alone ones that go beyond the day to day niceties - this group goes along way to solve that.”</p></blockquote><p>Want to join them? It couldn’t be easier. </p><div class="paywall-jump"></div><h3>How to join the private community</h3><ol><li><p>First, download Geneva to your mobile device <a href="https://geneva.com">here.</a> Downloading the app isn’t necessary, but I guarantee you’ll have a better time with the community if you do.</p></li><li><p>Read the <a href="https://www.notion.so/The-New-Fatherhood-Rules-f8b5ac8f061541a6be31ad98cbf9d5e8">code of conduct</a>.

I can’t bring myself to call it a Zoom / Videochat / Meeting, it feels too much like work. But “Summit” gives it the appropriate delusion of grandeur. </p><p>Most, but not all, events are at European / US-friendly times, with a few working for folks in NZ / Australia. The full events schedule of upcoming events can be seen <a href="https://lu.ma/u/usr-NmoTMacAIHTrq9C/events">here</a> and you can easily sign up and it’ll all get added to your calendar (but only if you want it!). Certain in-real-life events will also show up on that link, as well as in the Geneva app.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://lu.ma/u/usr-NmoTMacAIHTrq9C/events&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;See Events&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://lu.ma/u/usr-NmoTMacAIHTrq9C/events"><span>See Events</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>Random extra bits and pieces</h2><h3>Members-only essays</h3><p>There have been multiple topics I've been thinking about, and writing about privately, that I didn't feel comfortable sharing publicly. So I've been using the private post functionality here to create a smaller space where I can go even deeper into some of the things I've been thinking about around fatherhood, but not quite ready to plaster across the internet. <a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/the-tnf-member-only-archive">These essays can be found here</a>.</p><h3>Download the Year One eBook</h3><p>I took all my favourite essays from Year One of TNF and turned them into an eBook for members. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ifzddte1zhq817s/The%20New%20Fatherhood%20--%20Year%20One%20-%20Kevin%20Maguire.epub?dl=1">Here’s the epub version</a> (to use on iPads or other screen readers) and <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/jqxyhldirl75bro/The%20New%20Fatherhood%20--%20Year%20One%20-%20Kevin%20Maguire.mobi?dl=1">here’s the .mobi version</a> (to use on Kindles). </p><p>Wondering how to get the file onto your Kindle? <a href="https://www.amazon.com/sendtokindle/email">Here you go</a>. </p><h3>Pin Badge and Sticker Set</h3><p>Want some free stuff?

<p>Happy Friday. A busy week here, looking forward to downing tools for the weekend.</p><p><a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/talking-regret-with-daniel-pink?s=w">The discussion with Daniel Pink</a> landed yesterday and I thought we might use this week’s thread to talk about regret. </p><p>As he says in the book “Regret, done right, it needn’t drag us down; it can lift us up.” </p><p>Of course I’m not asking for your deepest and darkest regrets, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpDd7pQRKHI">like Leo’s elevator</a>. Something you’re more comfortable sharing—it might be a career mis-step, a moment of weakness as a parent (or as a child), or an “inaction regret,” a moment where you should have taken that leap. </p><p>Would love to know what you’ve learned from it too, if anything.</p><p>I’ll go first.</p>

<p>Mental health has been on my mind this month. The way this group of dads have come together around <a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/we-need-to-talk-about-dads-depression">the Therapy Fund</a> has been phenomenal, and has made me even more optimistic about the future direction of TNF. You’re an excellent bunch of humans.</p><p>I’m excited to share more details soon, but in short: thank you all. One final reminder, if you’ve been mulling it over for a while, but haven’t got around to it yet—this weekend is your last chance to <a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/subscribe">subscribe and have 100% of your donation go to the fund</a>. </p><p>Therapy isn’t the only way to help manage the mental maelstrom of parenting. Sharing is caring, and it’s a deep human truth that we find it easier to share openly with people who don’t know us than with those who do. </p><p>By my reckoning it’s been <a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/open-thread-how-are-you-feeling-565/comments">five months</a> since we did one of these, so we’re way beyond due a check-in. So, this weekend I want to know: <strong>how are you, really? </strong>If it’s helpful, pick a number between 1-10, and share a few highs and lows from the last few weeks. </p><p>As ever, I’ll go first.</p>

But you’ll only hear yourself if you <strong>really</strong> listen.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>I.</strong></p><p>It’s been a busy few weeks. Work has picked up, with some fun new projects. The <a href="https://on.substack.com/p/substack-grow-fellowship">Substack Fellowship</a> was transformational—whilst it became significantly more work than expected, it was a real “get out what you put in” experience. There’ve been a series of late nights at the computer: meeting with clients on the West Coast; writing and polishing up essays for TNF; chipping away at a gigantic boulder of email that continues to grow, a rock worthy of Sisyphus himself.</p><p>Sometime last month, long after the house had nodded off, I was putting the final tweaks on an essay for the Fellowship, jumping through a few posts in <a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/archive?sort=new">the archive</a>, hunting down a particular paragraph where I remember nailing a specific thought  perfectly. </p><p>Whilst sailing across a sea of open tabs, I stopped dead <a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/time-marches-on-never-ending">at this post</a>. It wasn’t the words that caught me, but the illustration from Tony. That one, up there ⬆️. It was, somehow, the first time I realised he looked a little like me. And that maybe I needed to listen to Kevin from last July, and what he was trying to tell me.</p><p>I’d was back on the road again, foot hard on the accelerator. Working on something I cared about, of course. But I’d forgotten the need to sit on the ledge, let my legs dangle free, drink a glass of wine, and enjoy the music.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>II.</strong></p><p>Since I stopped commuting, my podcast habit has died down—maybe an episode a week, or even less? But it was a pleasure <a href="https://tim.blog/2022/02/02/cal-newport/">spending two hours with Tim Ferris with Cal Newport</a> as they discussed digital minimalism, deep work, and the fascinating idea of “slow productivity.”</p><p>Slow productivity is best explained by looking at how the most revered minds in history approached problem solving:</p><blockquote><p>“When viewed at the fast scale of days and weeks, the famed scientists in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40941.The_Scientists">Gribbin’s book</a> seem spectacularly unproductive. Years would pass during which little progress was made on epic theories. Even during periods of active work, it might take months for important letters to induce a reply, or for news of experiments to make it across a fractured Europe. <br><br>The&nbsp;<em>daily pace</em>&nbsp;of their work was incredibly slow by any modern standards of professional effectiveness. When we shift, however, to the slow scale of years, these same scientists suddenly become immensely productive.<br><br>No one remembers Newton’s lazy lockdowns, but his&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophi%C3%A6_Naturalis_Principia_Mathematica">”Principia”</a> achieved immortality.”</p></blockquote><p>Newport suggests an approach for supercharging slow productivity: formalise your own rules and values, then set quarterly goals that ladder up to a long-term vision. This advice will be familiar to anyone who has worked in a tech company in the last 20 years, as it’s the foundation of the OKR approach outlined in John Doeer’s best-selling book “<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/54960827-measure-what-matters">Made to Measure</a>”. It has enabled companies to succeed by removing “conflicting priorities or unclear, meaningless, or arbitrarily shifting goals” that make us “frustrated, cynical, and demotivated.”</p><p>It worked for them. Could it work for us?</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>III.</strong></p><p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Only_Move_Twice">“You Only Move Twice,”</a> one the all-time great episodes of The Simpsons—if not one of the all-time great episodes of TV, period—Homer moves his family across the country to work for Hank Scorpio, an eccentric individual searching for employees with nuclear experience. To give you an idea of how much I adore this 22 minutes of television—my profile names for Reddit, Xbox Live and eBay are three different references to this single episode.</p><p>After being recruited to his new job for Globex Corporation—a reward for years worked and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ2-vLC3GSo">absolutely not performance-based</a>—Homer starts his new gig in a management position. He’s worked his way back up the ladder <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ri7o8uOdWts">after his last promotion was rolled back due to a hair-related incident</a>, and he’s actually, for once, trying his hardest.</p><p>Burns was a bad boss, but Scorpio seems, at first, perfect. However, we soon learn (<strong>SPOILER ALERT</strong> for a 26 year old episode of TV) Scorpio is an ersatz Blofeld-era Bond villain, and Homer is unwittingly helping him build a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_device">doomsday device</a>. It’s a purpose based job, for sure. But probably not the purpose you’d choose.</p><p>As part of his new middle management responsibilities, Homer tries to motivate his team:</p><div id="youtube2-r8miwsWtzRw" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;r8miwsWtzRw&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/r8miwsWtzRw?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><blockquote><p><strong>Homer:</strong> (in his new role as supervisor) Um, are you guys working? <br><strong>Employee:</strong> Yes, sir. <br><strong>Homer:</strong> Can you . . . work any harder? <br><strong>Employee:</strong> Sure thing, boss! <br><strong>Homer:</strong> Hey, call me ‘Homer.’</p></blockquote><p><strong>“Can you work any harder?”</strong> It’s a question I’ve been asking as long as I remember. It was already being asked of me, before I knew how to ask it myself. “Great potential,” my old school reports read, “but Kevin needs to apply himself more.” Another teacher helpfully informed my parents I was “one of the top pupils in the class, but it’s clear he’s coasting.”</p><p>I worked hard, and played hard, during my 20s. Probably more of the latter than the former. But towards the end of them I got a good job. Then another decent one. Then, after a lot of work, and what must have been a dozen interviews, I <a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/you-are-not-your-job">landed a dream one</a>. And I worked. Damn, did I ever work. If only those teachers could have seen me during my years at Google. </p><p>I really pushed myself: to do well, to get ahead, to try to make the world a better place. </p><p>I really cared. Until the day when I stopped.</p><div class="paywall-jump"></div><div><hr></div><p><strong>IV.</strong></p><p>There are two significant lows in my career. Both of them came while working at Google. I’ll save the first for another time, but today I want to share the event that changed my relationship with work forever.</p><p>It was 2017, and I’d been put in charge of marketing for a global relaunch of a key strategic initiative. You’ll know the app, especially if you regularly video call from an Android phone. It was one of those “huge opportunities” that you’re offered, a carrot that gets dangled with an accompanying vague promise of “well I can’t say you’ll definitely get promoted after this, <em>nudge nudge</em>, but it’d be hard for them not to …” It was a mammoth undertaking. 3 months of my life, in charge of developing, and producing, every piece of creative work that went out the door and the much harder job of getting it sold through the company.</p><p>The deadlines were tight. And any kind of “business as usual” approach would mean spending so long getting internal stakeholders aligned we’d be left with no time to make the work. But I had an idea—it was 2016, I’d been reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25814544-sprint">“Sprint”</a>, the authors worked at Google and, astonishingly, were located at the end of the same street, a five minute walk along San Francisco’s Embarcadero.</p><p>I asked if we could meet and discuss whether their process to “solve big problems in just five days” could be adapted to advertising. With minor tweaks, and making sure the people involved were aware of a few caveats, it would. So I tried it. I put together a small team—two writers, a filmmaker, and a designer—and went against the grain, a close-knit team collaborating with key people, eliminating the need for a gigantic, and expensive, ad agency. The plan made some people uncomfortable—we were live-testing a new approach on a huge project—but I assured them it would work.</p><p>That project took everything I had. My parents, sister and niece came to SF right in the middle of it. My dad took part in the <a href="https://waterworldswim.com/swims-events/island-to-island/">“Island to Island”</a> swim, following the supposed route of Frank Morris, John Anglin and Clarence Anglin who <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_1962_Alcatraz_escape_attempt">escaped Alcatraz Island in 1962</a>. This would end up being the only time my family visited in the two years we lived in the US, and I almost missed all of it, stuck in a Gmail interface beyond midnight, night after night.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3de9ad24-da1e-4103-a4a1-8025efc2347b_1665x1249.jpeg"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3de9ad24-da1e-4103-a4a1-8025efc2347b_1665x1249.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3de9ad24-da1e-4103-a4a1-8025efc2347b_1665x1249.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3de9ad24-da1e-4103-a4a1-8025efc2347b_1665x1249.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3de9ad24-da1e-4103-a4a1-8025efc2347b_1665x1249.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3de9ad24-da1e-4103-a4a1-8025efc2347b_1665x1249.jpeg" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3de9ad24-da1e-4103-a4a1-8025efc2347b_1665x1249.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:273135,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3de9ad24-da1e-4103-a4a1-8025efc2347b_1665x1249.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3de9ad24-da1e-4103-a4a1-8025efc2347b_1665x1249.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3de9ad24-da1e-4103-a4a1-8025efc2347b_1665x1249.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3de9ad24-da1e-4103-a4a1-8025efc2347b_1665x1249.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">My dad, somewhere in this photo ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ </figcaption></figure></div><p>Was it worth it? The project was a huge success: on time, massively under budget (production was delivered for 1/3 of the target, iirc), a campaign that moved every needle that was asked, and loved by everyone in the company, including the CMO who called it one of her favourite pieces of work from the year.</p><p>Shoe-in for promo, right? Apparently not. One of the people not keen on the new process was a Director (for those of you in with this world, you already know what’s coming) who told my VP I hadn’t been “a good team player” on the project, too focused on “creative excellence” and “innovation” instead of “stakeholder management.” And in that meeting, when I was when told I had “missed expectations” and wasn’t going to get the promoted, marked the beginning of the end of my time at Google.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>V.</strong></p><p>“You used to be interesting,” <a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/you-are-not-your-job">I was once told by a good friend</a>. It’s up there with the best advice I’ve ever been given—after the clear winner of being told to “get off this bus to Manchester, and stay here with her.” </p><p>When you give everything you have to your job, it doesn’t matter how well paid—or well fed—you are. You’re giving it all. There’s nothing left to for anything else. <a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/filling-the-purpose-bucket">I realised this back in 2016 and made a change</a>. Others figured it out before me. But it was when were all stuck at home, and forced to ask important questions on where we focused our energy, that we starting thinking about it together, kicking off what’s been dubbed <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-10/quit-your-job-how-to-resign-after-covid-pandemic">”The Great Resignation.”</a></p><blockquote><p>“When there’s uncertainty, people tend to stay put, so there are pent-up resignations that didn’t happen over the past year. The numbers are multiplied, he says, by the many pandemic-related epiphanies—about family time, remote work, commuting, passion projects, life and death, and what it all means—that can make people turn their back on the 9-to-5 office grind.”</p></blockquote><p>A huge caveat here: I’ve given more than one person advice to leave a job where they remained, and later cashed out with a seven figures (or more) payday. I still have the spreadsheet that helped me calculate the right moment to smash my <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2020/11/04/free-yourself-from-the-golden-handcuffs-for-a-more-purposeful-career/?sh=6571ff315003">golden handcuffs</a> into smithereens, landing on an optimal leaving date to enable me to retain my sanity whilst also ensuring the minimum amount of <a href="https://budgeting.thenest.com/unvested-stock-31525.html">unvested stock</a> was left on the table. </p><p>I could have stayed at Google. I could have moved to another relentless job at another company, continuing to chase what I thought was important, <a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/filling-the-purpose-bucket">trying to fill my purpose bucket the same way again</a>. But, just as Einstein <a href="https://www.history.com/news/here-are-6-things-albert-einstein-never-said">didn’t actually say</a>, “the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.”</p><p>You can’t have it all. 5 words so familiar, so clichéd, so assumed, we gloss over them when they appear. You probably did it, right then. But, again, for those in the back: <strong>you can’t have it all.</strong> It can’t be done: the ultimate dad, with the best job, hitting your ideal weight, seeing all the shows, reading all the books, fluent in another language, finally playing that instrument well, practicing self-care, nailing the perfect swing, being a supportive friend, a good son, the perfect partner. </p><p>All of that, and seven hours sleep a night? Ain’t gonna happen. </p><p>Something’s gonna break. For the longest time I thought it was me. But not anymore.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>VI.</strong></p><p>Last week was the first “quiet” week since work started again in January. It’s been an enjoyable year so far: a steady stream of interesting projects with smart clients; a Fellowship akin to being back to school, coming with a renewed understanding of where TNF could go; putting faces to profile pictures with some of you in the book club and coffee mornings; and exciting conversations with potential TNF collaborators to keep pushing it to fresh new spaces where we can continue this discussion.</p><p>This essay isn’t a blueprint on how to quit, a guide to going your own way.

That’d make the subject of a great book—maybe <a href="https://boundless.substack.com/">Paul</a> has <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60151185">already written it</a>. My path is mine. Yours may have parallels, but it’ll be uniquely yours. What I’m attempting here is to share a few vignettes<a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a> from along the way, my arithmetic in the margin, the different pieces of the jigsaw that came together to where it started to make sense for me.</p><p>The irony of all of this?

The better second draft came on Wednesday morning, and the “starting to actually make sense” one is happening on Thursday afternoon before I leave to pick the kids up from school. The final draft is another late night on Sunday, and a final proofread is happening at 11:40am on Monday morning. Now we’re at the stage where I <em>think</em> I’ve fixed all of the problems and it’s ready for you. </p><p>“When do you fit it all in” is a question I’m asked regularly.

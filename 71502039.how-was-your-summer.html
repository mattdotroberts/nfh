<p>Well, hello there. It’s been a minute.</p><p>A lot has been going on since we last spoke. I’ve been trying to get it into some form of coherent thought, but these writing muscles have atrophied after six weeks composing little more than the occasional text message. It’s taken the best part of an hour to write these few paragraphs. Bear with me, normal service will resume next week.</p><p>In the meantime, I want to ask a simple question—<strong>how was your summer?</strong> What did you do? Where did you spend it? What went better than expected? What challenged you more than you had imagined? How are you feeling as it comes to an end, and we head into the tail end of the 2022?</p><p>Look forward to reading about your summer escapades. </p>

<p>This week <a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/ill-dig-with-it?s=w">I wrote</a> (and <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-new-fatherhood/id1622182365?i=1000559462581">spoke</a>) about rediscovering Seamus Heaney’s “Digging” after becoming a father, stunned by how different it hits now. It was also the week I read The Shining was inspired by fears Steven King faced after becoming a father himself:</p><blockquote><p>“As a young father with two children, I was horrified by my occasional feelings of real antagonism toward my children. Won't you ever stop? Won't you ever go to bed? […] I wrote a lot of that down and tried to get it out of my system, but it was also a confession. Yes, there are times when I felt very angry toward my children, and have even felt as though I could hurt them.</p></blockquote><p>I don’t think I’ll ever watch The Shining in the same way. But I do want to watch it again. Soon.</p><p>A whole host of books, films, albums, poems, TV shows (and more) are entirely different experiences after having kids. <strong>Tell us about some that you’ve enjoyed. </strong>And don’t get me started on <a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/its-not-what-you-look-at-that-matters?s=w">Finding Nemo again</a>.</p>

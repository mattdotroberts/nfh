<p>This strep throat has wiped me out, and I’ve been feeling rough all week. I’ve noticed feeling meaner than usual … to myself. Self-critical, thinking I should be trying to do more, even though I’m <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJbR7K0E2Z4">feeling like a big duffel bag of shit</a>. Guilty because I’m not carrying enough of the parenting load. Defeated as I’m leaning on Bluey and We Bare Bears as temporary childminders more than usual.</p><p>I saw my reflection in the mirror before heading to bed last night and thought “fuck, you look terrible.” And as I caught the thought, mid-flow, I was reminded how we’re always tougher on ourselves than we would be with anyone else. How if a friend echoed that cruel internal monologue we’d figure out how to cut that toxicity out of our life.</p><p>So no real question this weekend. Just a reflection, and a note to anyone else beating themselves up over something: <strong>you’re doing great</strong>. Be kind to yourself. And try to do something nice this weekend.</p>

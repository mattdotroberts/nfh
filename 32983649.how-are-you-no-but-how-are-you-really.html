<p>Short one this weekend. </p><p>I want to know: <strong>how are you? No, but how are you, really?</strong></p><p>Let’s get used to moving beyond the rote response of “Oh, I’m alright I guess.” </p><p>Please let us all know, on a 1-10, how are you today and why.</p><p>I’ll go first, and looking forward to yours.</p>

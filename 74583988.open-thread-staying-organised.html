<p>Two full weeks in and we’re back into the cadence of normal life, and the sheer amount of logistics are weighing on our shoulders: making sure the PE and swimming kits are washed, ready and packed on the correct days; clashing delivery dates for homework assignments already rearing their heads; and let’s not even get started on the after school clubs and activities. </p><p>An exasperated dad shared his struggle at the school gates earlier in the week. He’s trying to get his family to start using a <a href="https://trello.com/en">Trello</a> board to put some sort of structure around their activities. Another dad told me how he and his wife are using Slack to keep things coordinated. In our house, the song remains the same: “if it isn’t in the Family Google Calendar, it doesn’t exist.”</p><p>This weekend I want to know <strong>what tools are you using to keep on top of parenting logistics</strong>? What’s working for you? What isn’t? Maybe they’re apps or sites, but I’m just as intrigued (maybe even more so) by good ol’ pen and paper methods. </p><p>Let’s see what we can learn from each other, and hopefully help a few dads along the way.</p>

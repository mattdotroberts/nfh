<p>The more eagle-eyed amongst you will have noticed something amis on The New Fatherhood.</p><p>40 issues, a series of private essays like this one, and close to 50,000 words (damn, that’s almost a book) spent climbing amongst the branches on the broad oak tree we call fatherhood. But there's something I’ve been intentionally avoiding. And it’s about time to get into it.</p><p>I want to tell you about my father, and the model of fatherhood I grew up with.</p><p>I’ll get right to it: my dad is an angry man. He's relaxed a lot as he’s gotten older (you'd be hard pressed to carry that amount of rage into your sixties.) But when I was growing up? He was short-tempered. Easy to erupt. He worked hard and drank hard, just like his friends, a group of Irish immigrants, working in construction and spread across the North-West of England. He didn't have the best childhood himself. It's not something he likes to talk about, but when I tell you he was the 13th of 14 children, in a family always struggling to make ends meet, maybe that's all you need to know.</p><p>The definition of normal to a child is what you grow up with—how could you possibly know any different? His childhood was normal to him, just as mine was normal to me. It's only with hindsight—and sharing the things you grew up blindly accepting with those who might not think them so "normal"—does your past start to take a different shape.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff5eca38a-3671-4a2c-8ff5-a57d68b2554c_1125x1084.jpeg"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff5eca38a-3671-4a2c-8ff5-a57d68b2554c_1125x1084.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff5eca38a-3671-4a2c-8ff5-a57d68b2554c_1125x1084.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff5eca38a-3671-4a2c-8ff5-a57d68b2554c_1125x1084.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff5eca38a-3671-4a2c-8ff5-a57d68b2554c_1125x1084.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f5eca38a-3671-4a2c-8ff5-a57d68b2554c_1125x1084.jpeg" width="1125" height="1084" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f5eca38a-3671-4a2c-8ff5-a57d68b2554c_1125x1084.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1084,&quot;width&quot;:1125,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:943800,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff5eca38a-3671-4a2c-8ff5-a57d68b2554c_1125x1084.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff5eca38a-3671-4a2c-8ff5-a57d68b2554c_1125x1084.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff5eca38a-3671-4a2c-8ff5-a57d68b2554c_1125x1084.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff5eca38a-3671-4a2c-8ff5-a57d68b2554c_1125x1084.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Meeting my sisters for the first time, 1985</figcaption></figure></div><p>I wouldn’t say I had an unhappy childhood—quite the opposite in fact. I remember constantly playing with my younger sisters, joking around the house, a boisterous trio with enough stories to fill a newsletter of it’s own. But there was a spectre of fear that hung over the house. My dad ruled with an iron fist, one that he wasn't afraid to use. My mother would look after us, 3 v. 1, while he worked away. Up until I was about 4, my dad would leave at 5am on Monday morning, heading further up north, toiling through sun, rain and snow—mostly the latter two—building out the UK motorway network. He’d eventually return home sometime on Friday evening, often finding my mother in tears, sat outside on the wall, having dealt with three children on her own for the best part of a week.</p><p>This wasn’t completely out of the ordinary back in those days. For someone like my dad, you went where the work was. He came over from Ireland, 19 years old, without a penny in his pocket, staying with brothers, sisters and cousins until he could find work and a place to live. Men were expected to first and foremost financially provide, and maybe get involved with parenting when they could—but it wasn't expected. If the bar to fatherhood is low today, it was subterranean back then.</p><p>My mum‘s ultimate threat to us was "if you don't stop, I’ll tell your dad when he gets home." This would cue an immediate stand down of whatever we were doing, swiftly moving to negotiations, desperately hoping to talk her down from that ledge. Because, whatever it was, if he did find out, all hell would break loose on his return. Dad's anger almost always led to violence. The violence was used to teach a lesson. It was used as a deterrent. It was used for motivation. And there were times it was just used because he lost control. He believed that violence worked: whatever we were doing wrong, we immediately stopped. So, for him, it did. </p><p>I have to believe, to this day, that my dad was being the best dad that he could be, given everything he grew up with. It's a dangerous road to go down if I don't. He didn’t have great examples of fatherhood in his life. I imagine my grandfather ruled his house with the same level of discipline—can you only imagine trying to keep things under control in a house with 14 kids? There are days I struggle with just two. </p><p>I'm sure I've spent more time this year thinking about fatherhood, and the type of dad I want to be, than my father, and his father before him, spent their entire lives. And for generations of fathers before them, so it ever was. It’s not entirely their fault. There were far more pressing things to be worried about: putting a roof over your family’s head, putting food on the table, worried about losing your job, trying to have a semblance of your own life somewhere in the middle of all of that. They were expected to provide for their family, and that was it. </p><p>Before I had kids of my own, I spent a lot of time reflecting on the father I wanted to be, adamant I wouldn't replicate the mistakes my parents made. I was so fixated on what they’d done wrong, and how it had affected me. But after my daughter was born I started to feel the opposite. I was filled with admiration for the things they’d done right, the sacrifices they’d made. I remember calling my mum in tears right after Padme was born, completely overwhelmed, crying “I can’t believe you went through <strong>that</strong> for me”.</p><p>Our parents grow up in front of us. We’re just oblivious to it. The fact that I'm a parent  is a big part of my life, but it's just a slice of who I am. But as a kid, your parents are your parents, and that's it. We were 7 and 5 by the time my dad turned 30. My kids will be 8 and almost 4 when I turn 40. I'm a dramatically different person—and a father—than I was three years ago, never mind ten.</p><p>In my experience (although your mileage may vary) having children has brought me closer to my parents. It’s given me a better understanding of how it must have been for them back then: two young people, just into their 20s, fresh off the boat from Ireland, in a new city, trying to make a life for themselves and their children, trying to parent the best they knew how. There’s no instruction book for this fucking thing, you know? Even now, with all the research, books, and ongoing conversations around parenting we’re bombarded with today, we're all still making it up as we go along.</p><p>Why am I telling you this today? Well, it's been a long time coming. The first draft of this essay is timestamped January 29th, 2021. I knew from the day one of The New Fatherhood that coming to terms with my relationship with my own father would form a huge part of this project, if only from the therapeutic benefit of self-analysis. I have so many questions to ask him, to understand his childhood, how it shaped the man he became. But it’s sadly not the type of conversation I can ever see us having. I want to ask if he spent time thinking about breaking the cycles of generational trauma, or whether I’m the first Maguire in a long line of them to do so. </p><p>A huge part of having this smaller, private group was to have somewhere I could share these thoughts without worrying about where it might end up, with someone inevitably messaging my dad a link along with "I can't believe what your son is saying about you on the internet." He doesn’t subscribe to the newsletter, and we never talk about it, and I still haven’t unpacked exactly what that means. Like a pot repaired through <a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/the-cracks-in-everything">kintsugi</a>, many of my cracks stem from my relationship with him, which has been in constant flux—broken, then repaired, and broken again—my entire life. This space is as much about having a place to bare my wounds as it is somewhere for you to feel comfortable doing the same. Each of our histories are unique but I hope you find solace in the parallels of your path with someone else’s. </p><p>Signing off with Philip Larkin’s “This Be The Verse”, a 50 year old poem that has been seared into my brain since I read it as an a teenager. Whilst the majority of it still rings true, the final couplet does not. Larkin suggests the best thing to do it to stay away from fatherhood entirely, but it was only after having kids I realised the essential role I had to play: doing the work to dismantle the generations of fucked up-ness I inherited, so they won’t ever have to.</p><p>— Kevin</p><blockquote><p>They fuck you up, your mum and dad.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>They may not mean to, but they do.<br>They fill you with the faults they had<br>And add some extra, just for you.<br><br>But they were fucked up in their turn<br>By fools in old-style hats and coats,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Who half the time were soppy-stern<br>And half at one another’s throats.<br><br>Man hands on misery to man.<br>It deepens like a coastal shelf.<br>Get out as early as you can,<br>And don’t have any kids yourself.</p><p><strong>— Philip Larkin, “This Be The Verse”</strong></p></blockquote><p></p>

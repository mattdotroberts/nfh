But this grief? I can’t even begin to comprehend. “No parent should have to bury their child,” was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcqLPalcpXk">memorably uttered </a>in The Lord of The Rings: The Two Towers. It carries weight because it rails against this unnatural order of events.</p><p>Last week <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-heaviest-pain-in-the-world-rob-delaney-on-his-sons-death-x3f79klxb">I shared this essay</a> from writer and comedian Rob Delaney, an excerpt from his upcoming memoir <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61295403-a-heart-that-works">“A Heart That Works,”</a> another father baring all after the loss of a child.</p><blockquote><p>“Henry’s first hairs fell out and he was bald again, and I would hold his head and kiss it and feel the warmth of it. It was such a pleasure to do that. When he grew hair after the chemo, we didn’t cut it and, oh my God, it was so beautiful. I loved to put my fingers through it and comb it behind his ear and just … I get mad when I think about how beautiful he was. His hair, his face, his eyes that were such a bright blue. It makes me angry that people won’t get to look at them. Those eyes were two of the most glorious things I’ve ever seen and it offends me that they’re not there for people to gaze into.”</p></blockquote><p>Grief is yet another item on the long list of “things men don’t talk about.” Creative solutions are required, with brave men stepping up to fill the void. One such initiative is <a href="https://www.sands.org.uk/get-involved/sands-united-fc">Sands United FC</a>, created by Rob Allen<a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a> after losing his daughter Niamh at 39 weeks. Rob wondered why his bereavement support group contained such a gender misbalance: 23 women and only two other men. He organised a one-off football match that raised £6,000 for the UK’s leading baby loss charity <a href="https://www.sands.org.uk">Sands</a>, and was then inspired to create Sands United FC, a local team for men who have lost a child. After a successful pilot, they <a href="https://www.sands.org.uk/sands-united-manager-application-form">allowed anyone to apply</a> to become a “local manager” of a new team, and now there are over 30 chapters <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1QHBLeMNz8YAgZtDC5odCEPvwBQfREFC6&amp;ll=53.67652825502882%2C-3.069088149999991&amp;z=7">across the UK</a> who play together every Sunday, the names of their children emblazoned across their backs.</p><blockquote><p>“Sands United to me is a safe place. An environment that has been naturally grown by the participants who have showed courage and bravery to support one another. It’s a place where amazing people use the negative experiences of losing a child to positively provide support to another family who have experienced a similar event in life.</p><p>It's given me the opportunity to share my feelings and feel comfortable with my loss but proud to have been apart of his precious life. Sands United has given me friendships I never anticipated but am now forever grateful for.“</p><p><strong>-&nbsp;Craig Spivey, founder of&nbsp;Sands United FC Hull &amp; East Yorkshire </strong><em>&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb89a3448-c23a-4daf-a37f-fd6b0bc7899f_960x540.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb89a3448-c23a-4daf-a37f-fd6b0bc7899f_960x540.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb89a3448-c23a-4daf-a37f-fd6b0bc7899f_960x540.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb89a3448-c23a-4daf-a37f-fd6b0bc7899f_960x540.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb89a3448-c23a-4daf-a37f-fd6b0bc7899f_960x540.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b89a3448-c23a-4daf-a37f-fd6b0bc7899f_960x540.png" width="960" height="540" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b89a3448-c23a-4daf-a37f-fd6b0bc7899f_960x540.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:540,&quot;width&quot;:960,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:278821,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb89a3448-c23a-4daf-a37f-fd6b0bc7899f_960x540.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb89a3448-c23a-4daf-a37f-fd6b0bc7899f_960x540.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb89a3448-c23a-4daf-a37f-fd6b0bc7899f_960x540.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb89a3448-c23a-4daf-a37f-fd6b0bc7899f_960x540.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>A situation you hope never to find yourself in, and a reminder to be grateful for all you have.

In short—you are all wonderful, generous people. <strong>Last month we raised $3,350, enough to pay for ten dads to get five sessions of therapy</strong>. The wheels are in motion with some, and plans in place to find more. When this idea started to come together I hoped we might raise a few hundred dollars but couldn’t imagine this would be where we’d end up. This feels like the start of something, and my heart is filled by seeing so many of you come together to create this impact. Thank you.</p><div><hr></div><h2>And now, for something completely different</h2><p>Signing off with a double bill of the OG Doggfather, Snoop D-O-double-G, who has been turning his hand to more kid-friendly content.

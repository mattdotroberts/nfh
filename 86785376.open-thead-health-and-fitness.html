<p>Some things take a hit when you become a dad. A fitness regime is a predictable casualty. When you start to care for an entirely new body—super cute, incredibly defenceless, comes with complete and entire dependence, available whilst stocks last—your own figure becomes less of a pressing concern. </p><p>And you know what doesn’t help? Knowing this is happening whilst the Overton window on “dad bod” is dangerously shiting from what was once a derogatory term for a paunching man in his 40s to now encompass whatever this is:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8021c1f6-03a2-4f32-ba7a-505390b333c0_1559x2189.jpeg"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8021c1f6-03a2-4f32-ba7a-505390b333c0_1559x2189.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8021c1f6-03a2-4f32-ba7a-505390b333c0_1559x2189.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8021c1f6-03a2-4f32-ba7a-505390b333c0_1559x2189.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8021c1f6-03a2-4f32-ba7a-505390b333c0_1559x2189.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8021c1f6-03a2-4f32-ba7a-505390b333c0_1559x2189.jpeg" width="1456" height="2044" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8021c1f6-03a2-4f32-ba7a-505390b333c0_1559x2189.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:2044,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:381640,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8021c1f6-03a2-4f32-ba7a-505390b333c0_1559x2189.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8021c1f6-03a2-4f32-ba7a-505390b333c0_1559x2189.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8021c1f6-03a2-4f32-ba7a-505390b333c0_1559x2189.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8021c1f6-03a2-4f32-ba7a-505390b333c0_1559x2189.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">This photo is—<a href="https://www.hola.com/us/celebrities/20220824336329/jason-momoa-says-he-has-a-dad-body-kristen-bell-smitten/">I shit you not</a>—what Jason Momoa, and the majority of the US press, have been referring to as his “dad bod.” I am sorry for anyone whose weekend has been ruined by this information.</figcaption></figure></div><p>It’s … something. So now, with the outline of Aquaman’s physique still lingering in your mind, I want to ask—<strong>how are things going with your health and fitness?</strong> Are you eating as well, or exercising as much, as you’d like? Are you taking care of yourself, and if so, how? Have you fallen off entirely, bad habits starting to outweigh good ones, but hoping to get back on it when the tiny human you love for can fend for itself a little more? </p><p>Remember this is a judgment-free, supportive space—if you’re not doing great, and looking for support, there are dads here who can offer it, a few years ahead of you. Ask away. If you’ve found any websites, apps or podcasts useful—share the wealth with the rest of us. And if you want to celebrate personal success, please do. I could do with inspiration, truth be told. </p><p>The only folks not welcome here? Those who wish to perpetuate the clearly dangerous rhetoric and body ideals of the aforementioned Mr Momoa.

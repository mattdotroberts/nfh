<p>I was emailing Claire from&nbsp;<a href="https://evilwitches.substack.com/">Evil Witches</a> earlier this week. We were taking about Father’s Day (June 20th in the UK and the US this year, if it’s not on your radar already) and she asked me whether “dads think as much about being off the clock for Fathers Day as moms do, or if it’s a different ‘feel’ than that.”</p><p>And honestly? I’m not sure. So I thought I’d throw the question out to y’all, and spend a bit of time thinking about the answer myself:&nbsp;<strong>“What does your dream Father’s Day look like?”</strong></p>

<p><em><strong>Holiday are coming, holidays are coming …</strong></em></p><p>Let’s talk traditions. I want to know what you and your family always do around this time of year.</p><p>What are your go-to Christmas movies? What albums do you play to get in the festive mood? Do you go all out with matching pyjamas? Is there an annual family Christmas card? Have you inherited traditions from your own parents? Or did you start new ones with your own kids?</p><p>I want to hear about them all. I’ll also be dropping a few of my favourite Christmas albums in the comments, and look forward to listening to some of yours.</p>

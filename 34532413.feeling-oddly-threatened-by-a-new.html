<p><em>The New Fatherhood is a newsletter from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.twitter.com/kevmaguire">Kevin Maguire</a>&nbsp;exploring the changing nature of being a father today. With tools, tips and hacks to help you become a better dad, and a community of forward-thinking parents who are looking to do the same.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/about">Here's a bit more information</a>&nbsp;if you're new here. My aim is to make this one of the best emails that you get each week. You are one of the 1,245 dads (and curious mums) who have already signed up. If you've been forwarded this by someone else, get your own one here.</em></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p><em>This week's issue is a little different. Since I shared my story about battling&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/when-fatherhood-doesnt-go-to-plan">paternal-post natal depression</a>&nbsp;I've been contacted by people all across the world. There's two emails I wanted to share with you all today: one from another father going through something similar right now, and one from a wife who saw her ex-husband struggle with it. I'm sharing these conversations, with their permission, to continue the discussion. Some names have been changed for reasons that will become clear.</em></p><div><hr></div><blockquote><p><em>Hey Kev! </em></p><p><em>Just a quick note to say “hello” and I hope you’re all doing OK.</em></p><p><em>Your writing about paternal post-natal depression really hit a nerve. My ex-husand suffered from this (amongst other things) after our daughter was born. Even though I spoke to health workers about it, they simply did not want it on their radar, and were very clear in their opinion that the father's health and wellbeing was not their concern. It was definitely a huge part of us not being able to stay together. He wouldn’t get help—and people were unwilling to help him—and I felt incapable to help under the circumstances. I’m so glad that you were able to get help, and your wife provided you the support you needed.</em></p><p><em>I understand that this email isn’t actually going anywhere. I really wanted to send you a message as soon as I read your newsletter. But I had to I take a lot of time to digest it. Then I felt shame for not being strong enough to help my ex-husband. Lots of emotions. Lots of memories. O’eck. But, it’s started a lot more conversations, and I’m happy to say it’s more (and rightfully so) recognised now.</em></p><p><em>Your newsletters are really powerful—they’re having a lot of impact, and I’m so pleased to recommend it to my father friends (and curious mums!)</em></p><p><em>I’d like to think that if you were still in London we’d be able to catch up over a cuppa—and I’m so glad to be able to read your writings.</em></p><p><em>That’s the end of my rambles,</em></p><p><em>Love to you all,</em></p><p><em>Eva</em></p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>Eva,</p><p>Thank you so much for sending me this email,&nbsp;and so lovely to&nbsp;hear from you.</p><p>First, I'm so sorry to hear about everything that you went through.</p><p>You wouldn't believe the amount of emails I've had from people telling me something similar—either men who went through it themselves, or wives who watched a partner go through it.</p><p>When someone is dealing with&nbsp;any type of depression, it's not just hurting one person. It has some sort of a blast radius that hurts everyone around them.</p><p>I will tell you over email what I would have told you if we were sitting&nbsp;having a brew: Please don't blame yourself. You were strong. You looked after&nbsp;your daughter. But there was&nbsp;a limit to what you could do on your own.&nbsp;It took me admitting to myself I had a problem, and telling my wife I needed help, before anything else could happen. If she would have told me “go get better”, before I admitted it to myself, I'm not sure things would have worked out the same way.</p><p>It's such a cliché. But change comes from within. You can't force it on anymore, no matter how hard you try. I'm lucky I found things written by others that helped me make sense of what was happening to me.</p><p>I really hope this newsletter can start real, powerful conversations around this topic, and one day we look back on waving away dads' mental health issues in the same crazy way we think about the treatment of post-natal depression 50 years ago.</p><p>Sending love,</p><p>Kevin</p><div><hr></div><blockquote><p><em>Hi Kevin,</em></p><p><em>Thanks so much for setting this up. Just read your blog on learning to love your son and your honesty in sharing your experiences is incredible.</em></p><p><em>I think that there is something in being a dad to a&nbsp;son&nbsp;in particular that can be quite challenging and it has left me feeling vulnerable at times. Like you I’ve got a daughter (mine’s 2.5yrs) and recently a son too, (1 month!) I found everything came quite naturally with my daughter, we’ve got a great relationship, she’s the absolute love of my life and we love spending time together. I’m always bigging her up and every time someone compliments her I love it!</em></p><p><em>With my son, I’ve felt a bit different though, and its certainly brought up some old insecurities and vulnerabilities that I’ve not dealt with, and that on reflection my dad never dealt with either. A lot of it is image-stuff and feeling oddly&nbsp;threatened&nbsp;by a one month old baby! Which sounds ridiculous to type out – (but I guess that’s why these things fester because we are too scared to admit them!)</em></p><p><em>I think that part of it is in being a son – they’re more comparable to you. Which is definitely something that people love to do – particularly in the early days.</em></p><p><em>For example, quite a few people talk about how big he is and that he’s got big hands and big shoulders (I have neither but my wife’s side of the family are some serious units!) So I feel insecure about that and feel the desire to talk negatively about him / verbally put him down to reassure myself. It’s 100% the relationship that my dad had with me—I cannot remember him saying a single positive thing about me growing up, but remember plenty of sarcastic comments to cut me down.</em></p><p><em>So I can tell that this will be a bit of an ongoing challenge for me, (amongst all the other challenges of fatherhood!), to confront some of my insecurities and demonstrate to my son a better model of fatherhood than I had.</em></p><p><em>I already feel that The New Fatherhood community can be a really useful tool / ally in this journey</em></p><p><em>Paul</em></p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>Hi Paul</p><p>Thanks for getting in touch. And thank you for your honesty. I'm so moved that you read the article and were inspired to respond.</p><p>I've found that, in my&nbsp;experience, when we open up and are more vulnerable with others, they will meet us in that place and feel more open with their vulnerabilities too And I recently discovered it's not just me who thinks this. It's a real thing: it's called&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@cfetaz/putting-the-vulnerability-loop-to-the-test-1844dbb2a3b0">the vulnerability loop</a>.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb42716bf-16b9-4a88-8c61-549fabd4e46c_1400x1081.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb42716bf-16b9-4a88-8c61-549fabd4e46c_1400x1081.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb42716bf-16b9-4a88-8c61-549fabd4e46c_1400x1081.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb42716bf-16b9-4a88-8c61-549fabd4e46c_1400x1081.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb42716bf-16b9-4a88-8c61-549fabd4e46c_1400x1081.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b42716bf-16b9-4a88-8c61-549fabd4e46c_1400x1081.png" width="1400" height="1081" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b42716bf-16b9-4a88-8c61-549fabd4e46c_1400x1081.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1081,&quot;width&quot;:1400,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:118047,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb42716bf-16b9-4a88-8c61-549fabd4e46c_1400x1081.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb42716bf-16b9-4a88-8c61-549fabd4e46c_1400x1081.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb42716bf-16b9-4a88-8c61-549fabd4e46c_1400x1081.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb42716bf-16b9-4a88-8c61-549fabd4e46c_1400x1081.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>It's one of the key things that inspired me to start this newsletter.

So thank you!</p><p>I also asked&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/what-are-you-watching-with-your-kids/comments">"what are you watching with your kids this weekend?"</a></strong></p><ul><li><p><em>"City of Ghosts on Netflix (it's not scary and talks about the history of L.A.) Beautiful animation. So smart! But already only 1 episode left!" </em><strong>Paul</strong></p></li><li><p><em>"We were making good progress through Star Wars Rebels which is great. But I have refused to watch it on the small temporary TV. (26" - which is tiny these days, but would have essentially been an IMAX back in the days of yore). I have given in and started watching Clone Wars with my son. It does a way better job of that period than the films did." </em><strong>Anthony</strong></p></li><li><p>"<em>We’re on watch through #2 of Waffles &amp; Mochi with the 2.5yo which is like Sesame Street meets Salt Fat Acid Heat. Not bad!"&nbsp;<strong>Eric</strong></em></p></li><li><p>"<em>Disney+ has gotten us through so much these days. But actually, one show that my kids are fascinated by is How It’s Made. Started showing them episodes after my oldest kept asking, “Daddy, how does ______ work?” Every episode entrances them, from the spacey, new age music, to the seamless movement of machinery."&nbsp;<strong>Hunter</strong></em></p></li></ul><p>One more thing before I go: I shared a tip on Instagram this weekend about <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org">Common Sense Media</a>, a site I religiously use to inform what shows and movies we watch with our kids. I will Google&nbsp;<em>"[SHOW NAME] + common sense media"</em>&nbsp;before anything. I tend to subtract 2 years from the suggested age, because I think the reviewers on the site are a little more conservative than we are. Here's an example page for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/tv-reviews/city-of-ghosts">City of Ghosts</a>&nbsp;(which I recommended last week, and will continue to do so!)</p><div><hr></div><h2>Say Hello</h2><p><em>Follow The New Fatherhood on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.twitter.com/thenewfathrhood">Twitter</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.instagram.com/newfatherhood">Instagram</a>.&nbsp;Send me&nbsp;links, comments, questions, and feedback.

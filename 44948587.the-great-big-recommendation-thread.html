<p>It’s December. You’re probably thinking about what to get the kids for Christmas. Me too.</p><p>This week I wanted to try something different—let’s use our collective brainpower to help each other find great presents. </p><p>Here’s how it’s going to work. Leave a comment if you <strong>WANT</strong> a recommendation, or if you have<strong> BOUGHT </strong>something in the last few years that went down a treat. Bonus points for those seeking and offering tips that aren’t just toys! Drop in an age if you can, it should help.</p><p>I’ll start with one of each:</p><p><strong>WANT:</strong> My son (2) is obsessed with Spiderman, and I want to find some good books to read with him. But everything is either World of Reading / Learn to read books, or terribly written short stories. And the toys all look like tat. Any recommendations on Spiderman gifts that are worth buying? </p><p><strong>BOUGHT:</strong> We picked up <a href="https://crazyforts.com">Crazy Forts</a> for my daughter (7) almost 2 years ago. She still plays with it regularly. It’s just like the way we used to build forts as a kid, but without the cardboard boxes and using the chairs from the dining table. Now our son is older he’s really getting into it too. Can’t recommend it highly enough.</p><p>Over to you …</p>

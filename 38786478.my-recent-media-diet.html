<p>Like I said in the first&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/a-weekend-note-for-paid-subscribers">subscriber-only issue</a>, we’re changed by the things we read, watch and listen to. So I thought once in a while I would share some of the media I’ve been consuming, and some personal thoughts, with this small group.</p><p>Fans of&nbsp;<a href="https://kottke.org/tag/media%20diet">kottke.org</a>&nbsp;might notice that I’m shamelessly stealing this idea from Jason. But as a member of his site I think I’m positive in the karma bank with him ... </p><p>I'm going to do something a little different though. I'm only going to share stuff I've loved. Life is too short to spend on anything less than stellar, and I've become much better at giving up on shows and books that aren't cutting it. So if I write about it here I am whole-heartedly recommending you check it out.</p><div><hr></div><p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10288566/">Another Round</a>. I’m going to go long on this one soon. I promise you. Because even six weeks after I watching it, I still see myself running themes through in my head. So much to unpack about meaning, our existence, our roles as fathers, husbands and friends. And having a good old time with a drink.</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Office-US-Season-1/dp/B00EU7Z3CY">The Office (Season 3+4</a>). The US version, fantastically superior (IMO) once you get past the sketchy first season. This is a current “fall asleep in bed to” show, but is so funny that often it does the exact opposite. The characters coming into themselves by this point, and some of the background characters become better defined. There's a few moments that are sadly starting to date, with jokes that were “borderline offensive” then are now just “straight up offensive” in 2021. But "Dinner Party" is a masterpiece, and I could watch Pan and Jim slowly sailing towards each other for eternity.</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/INVINCIBLE-SEASON-1/dp/B08WJMRHYZ">Invincible</a>. A new animation from the Robert Kirkman, the creator of The Walking Dead. I’m hyperaware of any fatherhood themes lately, and this is a fantastic one as a son gets to know his father better after developing superpowers. If you watch to the end of the first episode, I think you'll be hooked, and I defy you to watch it and not feel something as he watches his son play baseball in the finale. This is a really good companion piece to The Boys (also on Amazon Prime Video), showing the darker side of superheroes and the repercussions of growing up with an emotionally stunted father. Thanks to Kiko for the recommendation.</p><p><a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/en-gb/series/loki/6pARMvILBGzF">Loki</a>. Your mileage on this may vary, but if you're a Marvel geek there's a lot to sink your teeth into. We finished it last night, and while the final two episodes weren't as solid as the middle two, it does a sterling job of finally giving Tom Hiddleston more to work with than his occasionally anaemic forays in the MCU. Strong Doctor Who vibes too, which may make you want it more, or perhaps less?</p><p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7681902/">Won’t You Be My Neighbour</a>. I didn't grow up in the US, so am only familiar with the work of Mister Rogers as told by my American friends. He seems to have had an impact on the childhood of many and this documentary was funny, touching and so full of love.</p><p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3ShtO5VCYa3ctlR5uzLWBa?si=kLO73qdySUyRx8Jx3aCzBA&amp;dl_branch=1">Floating Points &amp; Pharoah Sanders "Promises"</a>. This album swept me completely off my feet. I’m not a jazz fan. It's one genre I've always struggled to get into. I wasn’t intimately familiar with the work of Pharoah Sanders, but working in a place like&nbsp;<a href="http://piccadillyrecords.com/">Piccadilly Records</a>&nbsp;you're always—like rats in New York—never be more than 6 feet away from a Sun Ra devotee. But I'll always check out anything that Floating Points does. And after a few miss-starts (trying to listen to it at dinner time with the kids, when I was cleaning up, or in the background while cranking through emails) I finally got the required one hour and sat down with a drink and listen. It’s a masterpiece. It truly is. I genuinely feel people will still be listening to this in 50 years, the way we listen to the albums of Steve Reich or John Coltrane today. It has opened my ears to a world of music that I’ve never been able to appreciate before this and might well be my gateway drug into a new world of jazz, something I’ve found impenetrable (outside of the obvious albums.) Once you get to "Movement 6", it moves from being simply great to something sublime. And Movement 8 pushes it to the divine. One of those albums that makes you appreciative ever extra penny you spent on your headphones / system, and a clear front-runner for album of the year.</p><p><a href="https://www.hbomax.com/es/es/coming-soon/friends-the-reunion?countryRedirect=1">Friends: The Reunion</a>. A surprisingly moving trip back through time. Whilst it missed an opportunity to tackle some of the “problematic” issues that hang over the legacy of the show, this reunion was well produced and full of heart (with a few mis-steps like "the choir moment” with a certain singer). The initial shock of their collective surgeries seemed to fade away after 30 minutes for me as their stories came to the fore. But that didn’t happen for everyone:</p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://mobile.twitter.com/nicolewboyce/status/1398712657830625283&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;I love that the friends reunion is a science experiment in how 6 very rich people approach plastic surgery&quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;nicolewboyce&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;nicole boyce&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;Sat May 29 18:47:39 +0000 2021&quot;,&quot;photos&quot;:[],&quot;quoted_tweet&quot;:{},&quot;retweet_count&quot;:719,&quot;like_count&quot;:19507,&quot;expanded_url&quot;:{},&quot;video_url&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true}"><a class="tweet-link-top" href="https://mobile.twitter.com/nicolewboyce/status/1398712657830625283" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-header"><img class="tweet-header-avatar" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/twitter_name/w_96/nicolewboyce.jpg" alt="Twitter avatar for @nicolewboyce" loading="lazy"><div class="tweet-header-text"><span class="tweet-author-name">nicole boyce </span><span class="tweet-author-handle">@nicolewboyce</span></div></div><div class="tweet-text">I love that the friends reunion is a science experiment in how 6 very rich people approach plastic surgery</div></a><a class="tweet-link-bottom" href="https://mobile.twitter.com/nicolewboyce/status/1398712657830625283" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-footer"><span class="tweet-date">6:47 PM ∙ May 29, 2021</span><hr><div class="tweet-ufi"><span href="https://mobile.twitter.com/nicolewboyce/status/1398712657830625283/likes" class="likes"><span class="like-count">19,507</span>Likes</span><span href="https://mobile.twitter.com/nicolewboyce/status/1398712657830625283/retweets" class="retweets"><span class="rt-count">719</span>Retweets</span></div></div></a></div><p><a href="https://www.theredhandfiles.com/">Nick Cave's Red Hand Files</a>. After his son&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/10/nick-caves-son-died-from-fall-after-taking-lsd-inquest-hears">tragically died in 2015</a>, and after a period of mourning, Nick Cave started a newsletter to answer questions that fans had. His writing is staggeringly beautiful, and touches on topics like religion, the nature of reality and grief. This inspired Conversations with Nick Cave, a series of intimate shows where he interspersed solo piano performances of some of this work with an audience Q&amp;A, that was as much group therapy as public performance.</p><p><a href="https://brokenrecordpodcast.com/">Broken Record</a>. This podcast series features Rick Rubin (and occasionally Malcolm Gladwell) talking to musicians about their process. It is consistently fantastic, but&nbsp;<a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4F0hakFniJIjVoZlAlL1IC?si=lRlxYoriRfKNktlkxXXtkw">this particular episode</a>, featuring a conversation between Rubin and James Blake, is a must listen. They talk about setting boundaries between work and life, finding inspiration through working on childhood trauma and the power of dissident voices in your creative process. It even touches on Marshall Rosenberg's Nonviolent Communication approach to conflict.</p><p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53698248-brown-baby">Brown Baby</a>. Nikesh Shukla, the writer behind The Good Immigrant, writes a book for his daughter about growing up Indian in the UK. As the father of two biracial children, this book felt like an essential education in growing up when you look different to everyone else, and uses a similar construct (with similar power) to "Between The World and Me". His emotive prose carries you through the book, and you can feel the love that endures for his sadly deceased mother: in one memorable passage he is reluctant to cook a home-made meal from the freezer, knowing it will be the last time he ever eats her food.</p><p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50202953-piranesi">Piranesi</a>. Another recommendation from Kiko (and actually his copy of the book, which I still have sat here in the house!) He's been trying to get me to read&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14201.Jonathan_Strange_Mr_Norrell">Susanna Clarke's previous book</a>&nbsp;for a while, but the 1,006 page count has been putting me off, so he handed me this instead. An absolute gem of a book. A mystery, caught in a riddle, wrapped up in an enigma. You'll spend the first quarter trying to figure out what's happening, and then tear through the rest of it in an evening, looking up at the clock to see it turning 2am as you finish the final page.</p><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/es-en/title/80049714">Master of None (Season 3)</a>. Holy shit. This was something else. It took me in, chewed me up and spat me back out tasting of glory. I don’t want to go too far into it without spoiling it for you. But as parents, you need to see it. It raises questions around how children change marriages, the importance we place on them, and the selflessness required when have them.</p><p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4eHb9wltVcb9ssSrhQGsba?si=Di_uTDsNRrKWYo-0JtF7BQ&amp;dl_branch=1">On Being with Richard Rohr</a>. I wrote a little bit about this in a previous newsletter, but dropping it here again as I think this is such an important podcast episode to listen to. He's a Catholic priest, although Wikipedia says "Franciscan friar" and my lapsed Catholicism means I don't fully know where one ends and the other begins. But don't let the religion put you off. He's able to communicate very complex inward-facing subjects in accessible language with personal anecdotes and an avuncular manner. One of many thought-provoking episodes from the On Being archive.</p><div><hr></div><p>That’s it!

<p>This week I realised that whilst I’ve spilt a lot of ink on work and careers—that <a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/you-are-not-your-job?s=w">you are not your job</a>, the <a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/the-death-of-the-commute?s=w">death of the commute</a>,  <a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/filling-the-purpose-bucket?s=w">filling your purpose bucket</a>, how to <a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/how-i-learned-to-quit?s=w">quit your job</a> and where you <a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/how-to-choose-where-to-live?s=w">might live if you did</a>—I’ve never asked that age-old question:</p><p><strong>What do you do, and how is it going?</strong></p><p>So let’s use this space this weekend to talk about work. Do you work for yourself, or run a small business? If you work for someone else, are you happy there, or have the last few years got you thinking of a change? Are you back in the office now? Hybrid? Fully remote? What about the biggest stresses you’re facing at work? And some of the things you love about what you do? </p><p>Come on, come all. Pull up a chair.  Let’s talk work. </p>

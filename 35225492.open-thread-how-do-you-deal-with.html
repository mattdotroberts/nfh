<p>If you’re reading this from the UK, and you’re in a pub garden: congratulations. The end is in sight. You might have even had your vaccination? We’re getting severe vaccine FOMO over here in Spain. It’s gonna be a while till we get ours.</p><p>This weekend, I want to ask you all <strong>“How do you deal with stress?”</strong>. </p><p>Feel free to comment “terribly” or “easily” if you like, but I’d love to know more. What are the tools and techniques in your arsenal that help you deal with stressful situations: fatherhood related, or otherwise?</p><p>Jump in the comments, share your tips, and hopefully we can all learn from each other.</p><p>And have a great weekend, wherever you might be.</p>

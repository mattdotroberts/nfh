<p>Back when I worked in <a href="http://www.piccadillyrecords.com/">a record shop</a>—before I started losing my edge, to better-looking people, with better ideas and more talent—compiling the end-of-year chart was a labour of love and an annual obsession. We’d painfully assemble personal top 20 lists, which would be collated by the shop-owners in the back room, until they’d fire up the white smoke and inform us of the recipient of the coveted album of the year. The final results would be eagerly anticipated by staff and clientele alike, but it was more than simply who sat atop the pile—the <a href="https://issuu.com/piccadillyrecords">end-of-year booklet</a> would fly out of the store and provide a second bite of the cherry for all. Because even after spending 40 hours a week listening to, talking about, and selling music, there’d still be a plethora of hidden highlights; mind-blowing records that somehow managed to slip by the first time around.</p><p>The end-of-year list has become a crutch I’ve continued to lean on, my time living the <em>High Fidelity</em> life fast becoming a hazy memory. Compiling this list gave me the opportunity to reflect on how things have gone through the year—both on the progress of this newsletter, and to take stock of all the great things I’ve watched, read, listened to and played: cultural artefacts I’ve managed to squeeze in whilst the kids were in bed; snatched moments whilst they were located in an adjacent room, haphazardly extracting every item they own before moving to the next zone of destruction. </p><p>So without further ado, here are my highlights of 2022.</p><h2><strong>The New Fatherhood Highlights</strong></h2><p>This newsletter has provided an opportunity to connect with all sorts of folks, and it was a delight this year to talk to two of my favourite authors about their books, and compare notes with fellow parents trying to figure it all out: conversations with <a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/talking-regret-with-daniel-pink">Oliver Burkeman on productivity</a>, and with <a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/talking-regret-with-daniel-pink">Daniel Pink on regret</a>. I’m excited to make these  more regular in 2023, and to get them into a recurring audio format. Writing about my history and experience with <a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/a-spiritual-patchwork-quilt">spirituality</a> and <a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/psychedelic-parenting-">psychedelics</a> has been on the cards since I started TNF, and it was a delight—and, to be honest, quite a relief—to see these subjects land so well with an open-minded audience. It was fun to experiment with <a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/ill-dig-with-it#details">how these essays could work as audio</a> (and it led to an opportunity to expand on these thoughts in a talk next year) but it was significantly more work than expected and somewhat unsustainable. Will need to find more time, or some external help, if I want to carry these on next year. Atop of all these moments, the apex was seeing <a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/we-need-to-talk-about-dads-depression">this community come together to start our therapy fund,</a> raising $3,350, which will cover ten dads to begin working with a therapist. </p><p><strong>Email Subscribers</strong>: 6,117 total subscribers / 3,327 new subscribers. There are more than twice as many of you here today as there were last Christmas. I will continue to say this until I’m blue in the face—as a parent, I know your time is your most precious resource, and I’m thankful you choose to spend it here.</p><p><strong>Paid members: </strong>160 total / 67 net new. This number has also grown, and the newsletter broke the $10,000 annual revenue rate this year. This income has have enabled me to pay for guest subscribers, illustrators, and will fund new work as I move TNF into the audio space in 2023. </p><p><strong>Most viewed essay:</strong> <a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/the-art-of-noticing">The Art of Noticing</a> (<em>March, 13,901 views</em>) Thanks to a push by the aforementioned Mr Pink (the author, not Steve Buscemi’s character in Reservoir Dogs) this essay became the year’s most read, and drove a significant number of new signups.</p><p><strong>Most opened email</strong>: <a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/time-to-recharge">Time to Recharge</a> (<em>July, 61% open rate</em>) This reflection on sabbaticals, vacations, and the fallacy of unlimited time-off, broke the coveted 60%+ open rate, falling at the perfect window after we all started thinking about holidays, but before we all went on them.</p><p><strong>Most Liked Thread:</strong> <a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/open-thread-how-do-you-deal-with-cd9/comments">How do you deal with stress?</a> (<em>February, 158 likes</em>) The New Fatherhood at its very best—a group of men talking openly about self-care and how they’re navigating the stress of parenthood.</p><p><strong>Most Commented Threads</strong>: <a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/open-thread-hows-work-going/comments">How’s Work Going?</a> (<em>April, 62 comments</em>) and <a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/open-thread-lets-talk-hobbies/comments">Let’s Talk Hobbies</a> (<em>April, 56 comments</em>) Clear proof, if it was ever needed, that we’re about more to simply fatherhood. The intersections of parenting and life’s other mysteries continue to be fruitful places for discussion, both in the open threads and the Geneva community. </p><p>Enough navel-gazing. Onto the good stuff.</p><h2>My Media Highlights: The Best TV, Movies, Music, Books and Games of 2022</h2><div class="paywall-jump"></div><p><strong>Best TV:</strong>&nbsp;An incredibly great year for TV. The recently wrapped&nbsp;<em><strong>Andor</strong></em> was both the <em>best</em> Star Wars thing and <em>least</em> Star Wars thing in a long time—probably not a coincidence. A show about power, set in outer space; Star Wars doing its best David Simon impression—it’s all connected. Every time the Death Star blew up, every Tie Fighter explosion that you cheered, every one of those million tiny exploded pieces was built on the backs of slave labour, convicts locked away for minor offences, propping up the military-industrial complex in a galaxy far, far away.&nbsp;<em><strong>Severance</strong></em> remains seared into my brain, months after the memorable finale. One of the most innovative shows in years, pushing the idea of work-life balance to its terrifying end-point, whilst taking potshots at corporate wellness and the LinkedIn bullshit machine. Squeezed in just before the end of the year was <em><strong>The Bear</strong></em>, vividly cooking up a melting pot of fire and chaos, an apt representation of the pressure cooker environment of life in a professional kitchen, and required viewing for fans of Bill Buford’s <em>Heat</em> or Anthony Bourdain’s <em>Kitchen Confidential</em><strong>.</strong> Also easily the best use of music in any show this year, with a particularly stressful scene set to Wilco’s “Spiders (Kidsmoke)” one of the year’s best: “COUSIN!”</p><p><strong>Notable mentions:</strong>&nbsp;<em><strong>Barry, Hacks, Ramy, Our Flag Means Death, The Rehearsal.</strong></em></p><p><strong>Best Movies:</strong>&nbsp;My 2022 scorecard is weighted more heavily towards a “want to watch” list than a “things I actually saw” one (<em>Aftersun</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>The Banshees of Inisherin</em>&nbsp;are still awaiting their official release dates here in Spain). But there were two explorations of family dynamics and intergenerational trauma that stayed with me: the first in&nbsp;<em><strong>Everything Everywhere All At Once,</strong></em>&nbsp;the mind-bending multiverse that The Daniels pulled us through, in a movie that generated a lot of chatter about googley eyes and hot dog fingers, but will be remembered first and foremost for its heart; and&nbsp;<em><strong>Turning Red</strong></em>,&nbsp;which explored many of the same themes but through the family-friendly lens of a teenager with a huge boy band crush. I didn’t think I needed more reboots in my life, but I was glad to be proven wrong not once, but twice: a fresh take on the caped crusader but mixed up with the best of David Fincher in <em><strong>The Batman; </strong></em>and<em><strong> Top Gun: Maverick </strong></em>which I rewatched on a flight to India, the 10G stealth opening scene perfectly timed with the plane’s ascent: an A+ multisensory experience, highly recommended.</p><p><strong>Notable mentions:&nbsp;</strong><em><strong>RRR, Chip ‘n Dale: Rescue Rangers, Marcel the Shell with Shoes On.</strong></em></p><p><strong>Best Music:</strong>&nbsp;If I were back in the record shop, I’d have a clear #1 this year with&nbsp;Kendrick Lamaar’s&nbsp;<em><strong>Mr. Morale &amp; the Big Steppers.</strong></em>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/kendrick-has-two-kids-but-he-is-not">Everything I wrote about it back in June still holds true</a>, and I get more from it on every listen—the gift that keeps giving.&nbsp;<em><strong>The</strong></em><strong>&nbsp;</strong><em><strong>Forever Story</strong></em>&nbsp;by JID should be ranking high in other AOTY conversations, and the self-titled album from&nbsp;<em><strong>Wet Leg</strong></em>&nbsp;was worthy of all the hype. But 2022 wouldn’t have been complete without a pair of women pushing things forward: Beyonce’s time-travelling trip through the history of house and disco with the sublime <em><strong>Renaissance; </strong></em>and Rosalía’s genre-defying <em><strong>Motomami</strong></em>, two albums that launched a thousand viral dance videos. </p><p><strong>Notable mentions</strong>: <em><strong>We</strong></em> by Arcade Fire (Win Butler’s cancelation notwithstanding), <em><strong>A Light for Attracting Attention</strong></em> by The Smile, <em><strong>Trust</strong></em> by Sohn.</p><p><strong>Best Books</strong>: This year I aimed to focus my reading less on the hot book of the moment, and towards others that have stood the test of time, based on Shane Parrish’s <a href="https://fs.blog/choose-your-next-book/">great advice to “let time filter books.”</a> This led me on a path to Hanya Yanagihara’s devastatingly beautiful <em><strong>A Little Life</strong></em> (2015) and Don DeLillo’s prescient <em><strong>White Noise</strong></em> (1985), two books that have already rewarded the time I put in, in all kinds of ways. But I didn’t discount the present year entirely, and thanks to Jon for sharing his love of <em><strong>Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow</strong></em> by Gabrielle Zevin in <a href="https://links.geneva.com/invite/1c92e01e-d3c9-4fe1-bb09-3f05c4801c3b">our Geneva recommendations channel</a>. I know I’m not the only one here who took Jon’s advice and was glad to have done so. I had hoped someone might one day write the great American video game novel, elevating the medium to the form of art many know it’s capable of, and am ecstatic to see this book finding an audience outside of the nerdier corners of the internet. For those still on the fence, it’s akin to <em>The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay</em>, but substituting comic books for a more modern medium of entertainment. I can only dream that the people who read this book will be inspired to pick up a controller and play games like <em>Journey, Braid </em>and<em> Ico</em> (the last of which felt like a huge influence on the in-game world of <em>Ichigo</em>) On the non-fiction side, <em><strong>Four Thousand Weeks</strong></em> by Oliver Burkeman rewrote the productivity rulebook, and drove a wholehearted rethinking in my own approach to work and <em><strong>Several Short Sentences About Writing</strong></em> by Verlyn Klinkenborg as the best book on writing I read this year—or any other year, in all honesty (it inspired <a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/the-art-of-noticing">this essay on the art of noticing</a>). </p><p><strong>Notable mentions: </strong><em><strong>Going to</strong> <strong>Pieces Without Falling Apart</strong></em> by Mark Epstein, <em><strong>The Omnivore’s Dilemma</strong></em> by Michael Pollan, <em><strong>Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell</strong></em> by Susanna Clarke, <em><strong>Draft No. 4</strong></em> by John McPhee, <em><strong>The Power of Regret</strong></em> by Daniel H. Pink, and <em><strong>Strength to Strength</strong></em><strong> </strong>by Arthur C. Brooks.</p><p><strong>Best Games</strong>: This was the year where I dipped my toe back in the gaming waters, and literally dusted the cobwebs off the controllers. <em><strong>Horizon Forbidden West</strong></em> sucked me in with its stunning visuals—with blood-red sunsets the finest ever committed to code—and a story that drew you into its world, and never felt like it was dragging things out. No small feat for a game I spent 50 hours with. A late contender that’s been sucking up any spare mobile moments over the last few weeks has been <em><strong>Marvel Snap,</strong></em> a digital card game from one of the creators of Hearthstone, which was a previous favourite waste of time on its release in 2015. Easy to learn, difficult to master, and incredibly generous at the freemium level, where you can squeeze a huge amount of fun, and develop serious mastery, without having to pay a penny.</p><p><strong>Best Wildcard:</strong>&nbsp;This was the year when the <em><strong>Sónar Festival</strong></em> and <em><strong>Primavera Sound</strong></em> tickets we bought in those early, optimistic days of 2020 could finally have their QR codes scanned and exchanged for wristbands. Whilst Primavera’s organisation and amenities left a lot to be desired, the lineup and sound systems were on point, and Sónar continues to be the best place for people-watching in all of Spain. Will hopefully be heading back to both next year.</p><div><hr></div><p>So that’s enough about me. Before I hand off to you for the final time this year, I want to say thanks again for getting behind what we’re trying to do here. I’ve gotten to know quite a few of you very well, and am delighted to be part of this incredible group of dads, and excited to be on this journey together. Can’t wait to see what 2023 has in store for us all—especially when we’re all ripped and sharing photos of our <em>huge gains and ripped abs</em> in the Geneva Fitness channel by February (at the very latest).</p><p>So … what did you manage to listen to when you weren’t forced to listen to the Encanto soundtrack for the hundredth time? What did you watch when you weren’t watching Cocomelon? To make life easier I’ll drop a template in Geneva, feel free to copy it over to your Notes app, and take some time over the next few days to compile your own highlights. Looking forward to reading them all. </p>

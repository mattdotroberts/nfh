<p>I first asked this in <a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/how-are-you-no-but-how-are-you-really/comments">February</a>, then again in <a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/open-thread-how-are-you-feeling/comments">April</a>, and in <a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/open-thread-how-are-you-feeling-fc2/comments">July</a>. </p><p>It’s such a useful check-in: to share, to be heard, to see how others dads are doing.</p><p>It’s been three months. So only feels right to do it again.</p><p><strong>“How are you feeling today?”&nbsp;</strong>Pick a number 1-10. Give a bit more info if you’d like.</p><p>Tell us how you feel. Then head off into the weekend. <br></p>

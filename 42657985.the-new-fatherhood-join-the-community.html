<p>Happy Friday. Hope you’re getting into the weekend, or at least on your way there. Thank you for supporting The New Fatherhood. Thanks to the few of you who’ve paid, I can do things like work with Tony and make some excellent merch that’s coming later this month (with close-to-cost-price-discount for you all, of course.)</p><p>One of the perks of membership is an invitation to join The New Fatherhood Community on Geneva. Your subscription welcome email contained an invitation link, but emails go astray and there are a few of you who haven’t said hello yet, so I thought it was worth sending a fresh invite to everyone. This button should get you in:</p><p>Join <a href="https://links.geneva.com/invite/1c92e01e-d3c9-4fe1-bb09-3f05c4801c3b">The New Fatherhood Community</a>.</p><p>If you’re already in there chatting, no need to do anything. If you’re not interested, no worries and thanks for subscribing! But if you’ve been curious, <a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/how-to-join-the-new-fatherhood-private">come say hi</a>.</p>

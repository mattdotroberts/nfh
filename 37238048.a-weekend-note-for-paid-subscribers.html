<p>Hello there. Here's the first-ever "subscriber only" issue. I wrote it late last night, as is normal with these things, and am now editing it in the morning to actually make it an enjoyable read. Hemingway said  “the only kind of writing is rewriting”, and that's my experience, for sure. You should see some of the early edits of these things. Actually, strike that, you definitely shouldn't. <a href="http://tonyjohnson.info">Tony</a> gets an sneak peek so he can get his illustrations started, and I often preface each one with a big "sorry it's horrible right now, it'll be better by lunchtime on Tuesday, I promise."</p><p>I wanted to kick this thing off by thanking you again for supporting The New Fatherhood. It's been such a huge boost to see people getting behind this, and has really opened my eyes to the possibility of what it can be. I've got exciting things planned, and I'm glad you're along for the ride.</p><p>So, I've got a confession to make. There was another reason I wanted to turn on subscriptions. One that I didn't really talk about, but has been rattling around in my head more and more over the past few weeks. There's been topics I've been thinking about, and writing about privately, that I didn't feel comfortable sharing publicly. So I've started to think about this smaller list as a space where I can go even deeper into some of the things I've been thinking about around fatherhood, but not quite ready to plaster across the internet.</p><p>The more astute amongst you might have realised that I haven't talked about my own dad a lot (if at all). There's a reason for it: there's a lot going on there. A deep&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/spelunking-into-the-well-of-feelings">"well of feelings"</a>&nbsp;that I've been working through over the last 38 years (generally) and the last 2 years (specifically). Honestly? I've had anxious dreams where something I write finds it's way back to him and he gets mad about it. So I've just avoided the topic completely.</p><p>But I feel this smaller group, and locked articles, can be a place where I can get a little bit more personal. I hope that's OK. And I trust that those of you reading this won't share any of it to the wider world (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntCno5LQbIA">"circle of trust"</a>&nbsp;time, folks).</p><p>There's other things I don’t want to share publicly, that I've alluded to in the newsletter. How my experience with psychedelics has made me a better father. How I've accidentally found father figures in friends who closer to my dad's age than mine. How some managers at Google made me completely reappraise the type of father I wanted to be (and eventually contributed to my exit from the company).</p><p>But I don't want this just to be a place to go deeper. I want to get into the breadth of experience here too. To share things not directly related—but often tangential— to the fatherhood experience. For those of you who've been spending time in the Geneva community, you've probably got a feel for these already. Movies, Music, TV shows, Books. And travel. Oh how I miss travel. Things that influence my experience as a father. You are what you consume. And I want to share what I'm into, and how it's changing my worldview, and might well change yours too. My hunch (and hit the reply button and correct me if I'm wrong, please) is what's bringing people to The New Fatherhood is around the feeling of—and yearning for—transformation: you're noticing things changing, the type of person you're becoming, the kind of father you want to be.</p><p>Someone told me a long time ago that there are only three things that change who you are.</p><ol><li><p>The places you travel</p></li><li><p>The things you read / watch / listen to</p></li><li><p>The people you spend time with</p></li></ol><p>It seems to have been true for me. So I hope to explore these things together.</p><p>Full transparency, because you all deserve it: I've been meditating on how my relationship to The New Fatherhood has changed since launching paid subscriptions. A good friend Nick sent me a message on the day I launched them. He told me "Congrats ... a big step but remember it’s just the first. Don’t put too much pressure on it or yourself."</p><p>It was great advice. My new mantra for The New Fatherhood has become “make it work without making it&nbsp;<em><strong>work</strong></em>”. Meaning, if it starts to feel like a full-time job, and I stop enjoying it, then it's an indication that something isn't right. Things can turn from "fun side-project" to "overwhelming anxiety-inducing obligation" very quickly. So I'm making sure that I create the space and conditions so this doesn’t become the case. I'd love to hear from any of you who have personal experience in this area too.</p><div><hr></div><h3>The New Fatherhood Community</h3><p>I've been loving the discussions in the community. You all seem like a fantastic bunch. For those of you who haven't already, I'd recommend downloading&nbsp;<a href="https://app.geneva.com/">the Geneva app</a>&nbsp;as it's a much better experience than their website (for those of you waiting for a Mac app, I have been talking to their product team, and it’s coming!) We're having all sorts of interesting conversations in there, and I think I've finally managed to get the channels set up in a way that makes sense. If for any reason you're having problems getting in (or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/how-to-join-the-new-fatherhood-private">accessing the post with the joining instructions</a>) just reply to this mail and I'll troubleshoot with you directly.</p><p>Have a great weekend.</p>

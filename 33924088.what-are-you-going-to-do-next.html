<p>It's been a year. Wow. </p><p>But the end is in sight, right? If you live in the UK or the US, you're getting used to that warm, fuzzy feeling from news of family and friends getting the vaccine. Things are starting to open up again. And, whilst we're not out of the woods yet, this might be the beginning of the end of it all.</p><p>So today, I want to know,&nbsp;<strong>what are you going to do next?</strong>&nbsp;This week’s question is intentionally vague. Maybe next week, next month, next year? It could be about holidays, work, hobbies, even ... maybe ... having more kids? </p><p>Tell us, what’s high up on your "list of what's next"?</p><p>See you in the comments.</p>

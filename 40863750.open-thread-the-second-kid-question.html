<p>This week's newsletter went after the most requested topic in my inbox: <a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/lets-talk-about-sex">sex after parenthood</a>. We've only scratched the surface, and will no doubt be coming back to it again. </p><p>Now I've got my sights set on the #2 question I get asked: “should I have a second kid?”</p><p>I'm working on an essay at the moment, but would love to hear from you all.</p><p>Please jump in and share your thoughts on baby number two. Do you have one already? How has it changed things? Have you breezed past two and onto the dizzy heights of three, four, and five? Are you waiting to see how things play out with the first before starting on the second? Or is one more than enough? </p><p>As always, there’s no wrong answers. Looking forward to hearing from you all again. </p>

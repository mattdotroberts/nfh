<p>Good morning to you all.</p><p>I'm here, writing again, after ten days of being "mostly" offline—a little internet browsing, a lot of reading, jotting occasional insights into Notion when graced with their presence, and the longest period of time since 2018 without opening a laptop—which was bliss. <a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/covid-positive">Covid recovery</a> is going slower than expected, progressing in more of a zig-zagging line than a straight one, but heading in the right direction.</p><p>We're currently in the UK, spending a few weeks with family and friends. We fortuitously landed here the day after (yet another) change the quarantine rules, freed from (yet another) 10 days of self-isolation.</p><p>I imagine you’re deep into school holidays, managing however you can (I'd genuinely love to know how you're getting on, please hit reply and let me know.) The "summer break" is anything but for parents: dividing time between work, kids, partners, other responsibilities, with maybe a little left after all that for ourselves. So the idea of "finding" twenty minutes in a day is akin to finding a £20 note down the back of the sofa: not at all likely, and even if you did, it’d already be spent by the time you figured out what to do with it.</p><p>Even so, I'd implore you to do whatever is in your mortal power to carve out that time today, or over the weekend, to spend with David Foster Wallace’s 2005 commencement speech to Kenyon College graduates. Squirrel away a little quiet time, early in the morning or late at night, to give it the attention it deserves.</p><p><a href="https://fs.blog/2012/04/david-foster-wallace-this-is-water/">You can read it—or listen to it, if you'd prefer—here.</a></p><p>This is normally where I'd write a little bit about just how great this essay is. But, honestly, there aren't words to do it justice. Or, more accurately, there are—but he used them all in the essay already. I love DFW’s work, with well-worn paperback copies of Consider the Lobster and Oblivion amongst the bookshelves. And no, before you ask, I haven’t finished Infinite Jest. Has anyone, really?</p><p>This essay is different from any of his others I've come across. It touches on topics I've been thinking about this year:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/spelunking-into-the-well-of-feelings">empathy</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/its-not-what-you-look-at-that-matters">perspective</a>, and what&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/filling-the-purpose-bucket">you focus your energy on</a>. It's about, in his words:</p><blockquote><p>"Being conscious and aware enough to choose what you pay attention to and to choose how you construct meaning from experience. Because if you cannot exercise this kind of choice in adult life, you will be totally hosed."</p></blockquote><p>You might have come across this speech already. This week was the first time I happened upon it. Perhaps I wasn't ready for it before. It wasn't time. The Eskimos simply "wandered by", as he beautifully puts it. Or my mind wasn't in, what David Whyte touched upon in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6052036-the-three-marriages">The Three Marriages</a>:</p><blockquote><p>"A beautiful stage of unconscious subterfuge ... when it is arranging for its own demise ... a time when books seem to fall off shelves open to specific references that remind us of something we have to follow ... the coming together of circumstances in ways that cannot be easily labeled and dismissed."</p></blockquote><p>For me—and if you’re reading this, maybe for you too—that time is now. </p><p>The choice of “what we pay attention to” is the most important one we make. </p><p>I thank you for choosing to pay your attention here.</p><p>— Kevin</p>

<blockquote><p>“When you say yes to others, make sure you are not saying no to yourself.” <br><strong>— Paulo&nbsp;Coelho</strong></p></blockquote><p><a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/the-one-word-that-will-transform">This week’s newsletter</a> was a tardy one, but seems to have hit home. I’ve had three messages this morning with some variation of “thank you, this was just what I needed to read right now.”</p><p>So I wanted to dedicate this today’s open thread to <em><strong>No: past, present and future</strong></em>. Tell us about a  <em><strong>No </strong></em>in your history that you’re proud of. Or share something you wish you said <em><strong>No</strong> </em>to? What’s on your plate right now that you’d love to <em><strong>No </strong></em>off into the trash? And what’s something you’d like to say <em><strong>No</strong></em> to more in the future?</p><p>Hit the blue button, and see you in the comments (or not, if you feel like giving this email a <em><strong>No</strong></em> too.)</p>

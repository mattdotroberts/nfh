I was in the middle of a convalescence period longer and less linear than I’d hoped it would be; in the middle of my lifetime, or at least approaching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_countries_by_life_expectancy">what the world assumes</a> will be the middle of it.</p><p>The middle gets a bad rap—lost in the middle of nowhere, their middle-of-the-road album, being stuck in the middle, giving the middle finger. But the middle is where life happens. It’s where you make the decision, consciously or not, on the type of parent you’ll be, and how your kids will remember you when they’re approaching a middle of their own. When was the last time you lost your shit at your kids? Were you “JUST IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING!?” You’re always in the middle of something. We all are. There’s never the right time. There’s just the middle.</p><p>“Mid” has become a term of derision for Gen Z, a quick three-letter slam, the insult <em>du jour</em> on TikTok, with over 2.1 billion views on <a href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMFrRfq7T/">the #mid hashtag</a> and no signs of slowing. “Meet me in the middle” we’ve learned to ask to those who hold their opinions tightly. We offer it as an olive branch, suggesting we’ll head there too, whilst holding steadfast in the same place we’ve always been.</p><p>But there’s joy in the middle. It provides a chance to take stock of where you are on your journey, and make any changes necessary. Are you still heading in the right direction? Is a course correction required? Or is another endpoint more interesting, fulfilling or desirable? It’s free from the heavy weight of expectation that encumbers beginnings; unlike dreaded endings, the middle is light on regret, and remains pregnant with possibility. The middle is a place to breathe, to think, to live and do. Stopping in the middle is a radical act—to forcibly career onto an immediate off-ramp, finish line be damned; a fearless leap off the treadmill, trusting the emergency cord to deal with the repercussions. When you stop at the end, it’s too late. You’re already there. Ceasing in the middle unlocks magic.</p><p>The middle way is a concept central to the teachings of the Buddha, who lived a life avoiding extremes, to, as Jack Kornfield one wrote, “deeply rest between the play of opposites.” Taoism sees the middle way as the line separating yin and yang, its curves remaining in contact with the world’s opposing forces, holding steady, never wavering. In&nbsp;Pema Chödrön’s “<a href="https://geni.us/vfn6b">When Things Fall Apart</a>” (<a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/spelunking-into-the-well-of-feelings">not the first time I’ve talked about it</a>, certainly not the last) she explores how “everybody's middle way is a different middle way,” and how this path “encourages us to awaken the bravery that exists in everyone, without exception.”</p><p>If it wasn’t clear from these ramblings, the middle has been on my mind. I’ve been dipping in and out of <a href="https://geni.us/A5vm">Henry David Thoreau’s Journals</a>, as recommended by Maria Popova during her <a href="https://onbeing.org/programs/mapping-meaning-digital-age-maria-popova/">OnBeing interview</a> from back in 2016. The bulk of this mercifully abridged retelling (the full version is 14 books long) covers a decade of Thoreau’s life, as he works his way towards 40 and beyond, the mental changing of the guard, a newfound awareness of what unites us, and how nature can accelerate this movement. "All men are children, and of one family,” he writes. “The same tale sends them all to bed, and wakes them in the morning.”</p><p>I’m knocking on the door of 40, unsure of who might answer and what lies on the other side. Covid has left me feeling old before my time: a battered iPhone from generations past; overused, scuffed, but still loved; the last of the Jobs era, desperately calling out for an upgrade; a battery that only charges halfway, no matter how long it’s been plugged in, becoming easily exhausted after a few hours of activity. What does it mean to raise young children as an older parent? When my father turned 40 I was 17, one foot out of the door of the familial home, unsure of where I was heading, but proceeding forward nonetheless. I’m heading into my own middle, just as my eldest child is approaching hers—8 years old, the remnants of the toddler she was undetectable, the signs of the woman she’ll become beginning to take the stage as she heads into double digits and beyond. Where will we find ourselves as we exit our middles? We can only wait to find out.</p><blockquote><p>“When we discover the middle path, we neither remove ourselves from the world nor get lost in it. Instead of seeking resolution, waiting for the chord at the end of a song, we let ourselves open and relax. In the middle we discover that the world is workable.”<br><strong>— Jack Kornfield, The Wise Heart</strong></p></blockquote><div><hr></div><h2>3 things to read this week</h2><ol><li><p><strong><a href="https://archive.ph/MBOVB">“The Heaviest Pain in the World”</a> by Rob Delaney in The Times.</strong> Rob Delaney, Twitter funnyman and co-writer of Catastrophe, shares this deeply personal book excerpt on living with his son Henry’s brain tumour, and going on without him. “You sit there like a decaying disused train station while freight train after freight train overloaded with pain roars through you. Maybe one will derail and explode, destroying the station and killing you, and you can go and be with your child. Would that be so bad?”</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.thecut.com/2022/09/republicans-have-a-dad-problem-after-roe.html">“The Dads Who Got Woke After&nbsp;</a></strong><em><strong><a href="https://www.thecut.com/2022/09/republicans-have-a-dad-problem-after-roe.html">Roe</a></strong></em><strong><a href="https://www.thecut.com/2022/09/republicans-have-a-dad-problem-after-roe.html">&nbsp;Fell”</a> by Angela Chapin in The Cut.</strong> A look inside the world of right-leaning dads experiencing a shift in political allegiances in the wake of Republicans overturning women’s rights. “Fox News polling showed that between May and August, months consumed by fallout over the&nbsp;Dobbs v. Jackson decision, there was a 28-point shift in the number of fathers with children under 18 who said they’d vote for a Democratic candidate. That swing is significant compared to men in general, who moved only four points left.”</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/22/well/family/post-traumatic-growth-covid.html">“How We Can Help Children Grow in the Wake of a Crisis”</a>&nbsp;by Anya Kamenetz in The New York Times.</strong>&nbsp;It’s still far too early to tell what the lasting social repercussions of the pandemic will be. But that doesn’t mean we can’t take measures to mitigate problematic outcomes. This article outlines five strategies that parents can use to foster growth amid the fallout and is a great place to start.</p></li></ol><div><hr></div><h2>Good Dadvice</h2><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/kelseyfarish/status/1571490569767251968?s=46&amp;t=SZgn_tZBUGvart4UX0-S0w&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;Thanks for the push notification, Siri - that’s exactly what I needed in that moment 🫠 &quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;KelseyFarish&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Kelsey Farish&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;Sun Sep 18 13:25:23 +0000 2022&quot;,&quot;photos&quot;:[{&quot;img_url&quot;:&quot;https://pbs.substack.com/media/Fc8OV-iX0AI32mJ.jpg&quot;,&quot;link_url&quot;:&quot;https://t.co/UJeu74kUpK&quot;,&quot;alt_text&quot;:null}],&quot;quoted_tweet&quot;:{},&quot;retweet_count&quot;:13323,&quot;like_count&quot;:188009,&quot;expanded_url&quot;:{},&quot;video_url&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true}"><a class="tweet-link-top" href="https://twitter.com/kelseyfarish/status/1571490569767251968?s=46&amp;t=SZgn_tZBUGvart4UX0-S0w" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-header"><img class="tweet-header-avatar" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/twitter_name/w_96/KelseyFarish.jpg" alt="Twitter avatar for @KelseyFarish" loading="lazy"><div class="tweet-header-text"><span class="tweet-author-name">Kelsey Farish </span><span class="tweet-author-handle">@KelseyFarish</span></div></div><div class="tweet-text">Thanks for the push notification, Siri - that’s exactly what I needed in that moment 🫠 </div><div class="tweet-photos-container one"><div class="tweet-photo-wrapper "><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_600,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fpbs.substack.com%2Fmedia%2FFc8OV-iX0AI32mJ.jpg"><img class="tweet-photo" src="https://pbs.substack.com/media/Fc8OV-iX0AI32mJ.jpg" alt="Image" loading="lazy"></picture></div></div></a><a class="tweet-link-bottom" href="https://twitter.com/kelseyfarish/status/1571490569767251968?s=46&amp;t=SZgn_tZBUGvart4UX0-S0w" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-footer"><span class="tweet-date">1:25 PM ∙ Sep 18, 2022</span><hr><div class="tweet-ufi"><span href="https://twitter.com/kelseyfarish/status/1571490569767251968?s=46&amp;t=SZgn_tZBUGvart4UX0-S0w/likes" class="likes"><span class="like-count">188,009</span>Likes</span><span href="https://twitter.com/kelseyfarish/status/1571490569767251968?s=46&amp;t=SZgn_tZBUGvart4UX0-S0w/retweets" class="retweets"><span class="rt-count">13,323</span>Retweets</span></div></div></a></div><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/lilydsmith/status/1576011384747610112?s=46&amp;t=G4DMFWwdlU9y9P-fyiVd7w&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;This can’t possibly be the same 9pm I used to be starting to get ready for a night out at&quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;lilydsmith&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;The Ginger Swindler&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;Sat Oct 01 00:49:29 +0000 2022&quot;,&quot;photos&quot;:[],&quot;quoted_tweet&quot;:{},&quot;retweet_count&quot;:20924,&quot;like_count&quot;:160875,&quot;expanded_url&quot;:{},&quot;video_url&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true}"><a class="tweet-link-top" href="https://twitter.com/lilydsmith/status/1576011384747610112?s=46&amp;t=G4DMFWwdlU9y9P-fyiVd7w" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-header"><img class="tweet-header-avatar" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/twitter_name/w_96/lilydsmith.jpg" alt="Twitter avatar for @lilydsmith" loading="lazy"><div class="tweet-header-text"><span class="tweet-author-name">The Ginger Swindler </span><span class="tweet-author-handle">@lilydsmith</span></div></div><div class="tweet-text">This can’t possibly be the same 9pm I used to be starting to get ready for a night out at</div></a><a class="tweet-link-bottom" href="https://twitter.com/lilydsmith/status/1576011384747610112?s=46&amp;t=G4DMFWwdlU9y9P-fyiVd7w" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-footer"><span class="tweet-date">12:49 AM ∙ Oct 1, 2022</span><hr><div class="tweet-ufi"><span href="https://twitter.com/lilydsmith/status/1576011384747610112?s=46&amp;t=G4DMFWwdlU9y9P-fyiVd7w/likes" class="likes"><span class="like-count">160,875</span>Likes</span><span href="https://twitter.com/lilydsmith/status/1576011384747610112?s=46&amp;t=G4DMFWwdlU9y9P-fyiVd7w/retweets" class="retweets"><span class="rt-count">20,924</span>Retweets</span></div></div></a></div><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/mikejamesauthor/status/1581985668137644032?s=46&amp;t=cD5gHvoIu0REM8zbyLVcjg&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;My wife makes us put $5 in the \&quot;find jar\&quot;

<p>This week <a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/9-recent-events-that-pushed-me-to">I wrote about losing my shit</a>. And from the messages it inspired, it’s clear I’m not alone. One dad emailed to let me know “It’s nice to know my 3yo isn’t unique in his ability to drive me nuts.”</p><p>This weekend I’d love to talk about <strong>how you deal with anger. </strong>When does it show up? What role does it play in your house, and how is that different from your own childhood? How do you feel in the aftermath? </p><p>And, for those who’ve come across surefire ways to manage the red mist, ensuring it dissipates before the critical moment, share them in the comments. I’m sure other dads here would be happy to hear them. </p><p>As ever, I’ll go first. </p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/open-thread-anger-management/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/open-thread-anger-management/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p></p>

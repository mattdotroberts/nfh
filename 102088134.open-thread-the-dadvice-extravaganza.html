Unsolicited parenting advice, even more so. But good advice, a juicy morsel delivered at the right time, from the right person, can be manna from heaven. It can be the breaking of a lock, the unrolling of a boulder, a sudden lightness of being, a removal of weight being struggled with silently. But the first hurdle to getting that advice is putting the request out there. So for the next few days, whilst I’m putting the final touches to an essay that has remained stubbornly in the realms of “good” and resists all efforts to push it to “great,” I want to offer up this space as <strong>A Dadvice Extravaganza</strong>.</p><p>Picture yourself, for a minute, at an event with other men. Research has shown women prefer “face to face” activities, whilst men tend to prefer “shoulder to shoulder” ones—think watching the kids’ football game, propping up the bar, or rotating sausages by a BBQ. Got one? Well, instead of a few dads, picture close to 7,000. And we’re all telling the first dad he’s leaving those burgers on for too long. </p><p>A few thousand of what I’d say are the smartest and nicest dads out there—though I’m clearly biased—ready to answer whatever you might want to ask. So what do you want to know? Go nuts. Are you wondering whether it’s still too early to buy a fully electric family car, or whether you should just buy the damn minivan? Are you struggling with a change in routine at home, and looking for a friendly ear, and maybe a solution? (Remember, <a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/publish/post/34212717">the last time meditation</a> works wonders for all who fall into its loving embrace.) Looking for recommendations on what to watch, read or listen to? Wondering where your career is going, and what to do about work, when the swirl seems stronger than ever? </p><p>Whatever is on your mind. Come one, come all. Ask, and ye shall receive.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/open-thread-the-dadvice-extravaganza/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/open-thread-the-dadvice-extravaganza/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p>Also, a quick housekeeping note. Most paid newsletters do so, but I’ve resisted putting these threads behind the paywall. I feel it’s against the spirit of a place that promotes openness and vulnerability to lock out dads who don’t pay an entry fee. But as we’ve found repeatedly with our Geneva community, dads feel more comfortable opening up in a private space, knowing it is safe and free from the worry of a comment that might follow them around the internet. </p><p>In an attempt to split the difference, I’ve started locking posts and threads after a year. The upside is that whatever you write will be locked away after 12 months. The downside is that older essays will be available only to paid subscribers (or by searching through your Gmail, of course). But I think it’s a worthy trade-off. Thanks again to the cabal of paid subscribers that keep those doors open for everyone else. You really should join them. There’s never been a better time to do it.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/subscribe?coupon=4e4a8e60&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Get 33% off forever&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/subscribe?coupon=4e4a8e60"><span>Get 33% off forever</span></a></p>

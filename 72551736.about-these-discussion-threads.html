<p>Back on the laptop, back to the Substack dashboard, and back to regular programming.</p><p>The New Fatherhood is coming up on its second anniversary. And it’s become much more than I ever could have imagined, <a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/welcome-to-tnf">when I hammered a few hundred words</a> one January afternoon. I’ve spent a lot of time over the summer reflecting on where it’s going, and honing in on why it exists—not just for me, but for all of you.</p><p>Part of that is having a rethink of the cadence of the newsletter. I don’t want to be clogging up your inbox for the sake of a conversation every Friday. But, on the other hand, these threads have been a powerful way to get to know one another, and feed into some of the broader conversations and themes of the newsletter. </p><p>Enough about me. What do you think?</p><div class="poll-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:10700}"></div><p>And a little follow-up. If you were to take over for a weekend, <strong>what would you ask here? </strong>There’s a big group of over 5,000 people, roughly 80% of them are dads (or soon to be.) What would you like to know? </p><p>(Also, to the many mums who read the newsletter—you’re welcome in the comments anytime, this weekend more than ever.)</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/about-these-discussion-threads/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/about-these-discussion-threads/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p></p>

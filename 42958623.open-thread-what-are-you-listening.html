<p>Happy almost-the-weekend folks. As the seasons start to change, and the evenings get darker, I find myself switching up the music as I think about hunkering down. </p><p>I wonder if I’m the only one. So today I’d love to know: <strong>what have you been listening to lately?</strong> Music, podcasts, audiobooks. Anything. What’s in your ears, and what’s floating your boat? </p><p>Always on the hunt for something different to listen to, new or old. </p><p>Hit the big blue button below and share something that’s been doing it for you. ↙️</p>

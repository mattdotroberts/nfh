<p>Some things take a hit when you become a dad. A fitness regime is one predictable casualty. When you’re required to start looking after an entirely new body—super cute, incredibly defenceless, comes with full and entire dependence, available whilst stocks last—your own figure becomes less of a priority. </p><p>And with the Overton window on “dad bod” dangerously shiting—from what was a derogatory term for a paunching man in his 40s to now encompass whatever this is:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8021c1f6-03a2-4f32-ba7a-505390b333c0_1559x2189.jpeg"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8021c1f6-03a2-4f32-ba7a-505390b333c0_1559x2189.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8021c1f6-03a2-4f32-ba7a-505390b333c0_1559x2189.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8021c1f6-03a2-4f32-ba7a-505390b333c0_1559x2189.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8021c1f6-03a2-4f32-ba7a-505390b333c0_1559x2189.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8021c1f6-03a2-4f32-ba7a-505390b333c0_1559x2189.jpeg" width="1456" height="2044" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8021c1f6-03a2-4f32-ba7a-505390b333c0_1559x2189.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:2044,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:381640,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8021c1f6-03a2-4f32-ba7a-505390b333c0_1559x2189.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8021c1f6-03a2-4f32-ba7a-505390b333c0_1559x2189.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8021c1f6-03a2-4f32-ba7a-505390b333c0_1559x2189.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8021c1f6-03a2-4f32-ba7a-505390b333c0_1559x2189.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">This photo is—<a href="https://www.hola.com/us/celebrities/20220824336329/jason-momoa-says-he-has-a-dad-body-kristen-bell-smitten/">I shit you not</a>—what Jason Momoa, and the majority of the US press, refer to as his “dad bod.” I am sorry for anyone whose Friday has been ruined by this information.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Well. It’s something. So today I want to ask—<strong>how are things going around health and fitness?</strong> Are you eating as well, or exercising as much as you’d like? Are you taking care of yourself, and if so, how? Are bad habits starting to outweigh good ones? Have you fallen off entirely, but hope to get back on it when the tiny human you’re caring for can fend for itself a little more? </p><p>Remember this is a judgment-free, supportive space—if you’re not doing great, and looking for support, there are more than a few dads here who can offer it, a few years ahead of you. Ask away. And if you want to celebrate any personal success, please do. I could do with inspiration, truth be told. </p><p>The only folks not welcome here? Those who perpetuate the dangerous rhetoric and body ideals of the aforementioned Mr. Momoa. You can give this one a miss. </p>

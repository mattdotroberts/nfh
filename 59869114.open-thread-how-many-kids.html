<p>A few years I asked a good friend, a father of four, how he manages it. We only had one back then, were contemplating a second and I wanted to get a better idea of what might be in store.</p><p>He told me, “you know how many kids are too many? However many you have, plus one.”</p><p>It’s true. Two kids are more than double the work, somehow. But I see families with three kids and wonder how they’re keeping their heads above water. </p><p>This weekend I wanted to ask you all <strong>how many kids do you have, and how many would you like? </strong>Are you one and done? If you had a second, how did that change things? And if you’re the proud owner of a minivan and hoping to fill it with your offspring, I want to know all about it. </p>

<p>Hope you've had a nice weekend. I went to get my first vaccine this morning which was an unexpectedly emotional experience. I'm writing this with a left-arm that feels like it's being pulled down by an invisible weight, so I'll try to keep this brief (but going back and editing I can see I'm almost at 1,000 words. Pith was never a strength of mine.)</p><p>For those of you who&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/one-daily-habit-to-make-fatherhood">read the musings on meditation</a>&nbsp;and wanted to join the 28 day experiment—<strong>we're going to start tomorrow (Monday 28th June)</strong>&nbsp;and here’s what you need to do to get ready.</p><ol><li><p><a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/how-to-join-the-new-fatherhood-private">Join The New Fatherhood community on Geneva</a>. I'm pretty sure most of you are already in there, but adding this one in here just in case. <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/geneva/id1478573199">Download the app</a> if you haven’t already.</p></li><li><p>Open it up and in the bottom left corner you'll see a little calendar icon. Click it and join the event. That’ll give me a good idea how many of us there are.</p></li><li><p>Now you need to get the Waking Up app and activate the free trial. I'd recommend doing this step on your mobile device as it'll make downloading and signing into the app a more streamlined process.&nbsp;<a href="https://dynamic.wakingup.com/redeemMonth/a4d474">Click this link</a>, sign-in, and listen to Sam Harris explain how the course will work.</p></li></ol><p>OK. That's it. You're ready to start tomorrow. Here's what you need to know:</p><ol><li><p>For the next 28 days, we'll work through the Introductory Course inside the app. They've recently updated it to be focused on both the practice and the theory, so you get a better understanding of both how to do it <em>and</em> how it works.</p></li><li><p>Try and find a quiet place to sit and practice the daily meditation. They're generally less than 10 minutes a day, but a few are 12-13 minutes long.</p></li><li><p>I'd look at the "Theory" parts (the ones not titled "Meditation 1, 2 ,3 ...) as optional. If you can only manage 10 minutes a day, focus on the main meditation stages. But if you can find the time in the day to listen to the theory it’ll be a massive help on your journey. For these parts, you don't need to be sat somewhere quiet. You can do them anywhere — out walking the dog, cooking dinner, any task where your brain can spare a few cycles to concentrate on what's being said.</p></li><li><p>Each day I'll listen to the same two things you do and will start a daily post in the "Intro to Meditation" room in Geneva. Jump in and share some thoughts, or any questions you might have.</p></li><li><p>As we get to the end of this, and depending on how people are feeling about it, we might try and do some kind of wrap-up call and share our experiences.</p></li></ol><p>Here's a few tips before we get started.</p><ul><li><p>Most meditation guides will tell you that in order to make it a habit you need to do it at the same time everyday. I know, as a parent, this isn't always possible. But what you can almost always do is to find 10 minutes somewhere. I tend to either do it in the morning (if I'm up before the kids), during a short window in the daytime when they're at school and I'm not in meetings, or in the evening once they've gone to sleep.</p></li><li><p>The practice can be done anywhere, so long as you won't be disturbed mid-way through. Don't feel you need to be sat cross-legged on a cushion. In fact, that can actually do more harm than good when you’re starting out. Try and find somewhere that you won't be disturbed, but don't worry about a little bit of background noise. I tend to use a pair of Airpods and sit in the bedroom, but I've also done it outside on a park bench, or sat parked up in a car before I head back into the house.</p></li><li><p>The benefits of this thing won't be apparently immediate. It's not like you'll sit down for 10 minutes and feel different immediately. But I've found it's a little like compound interest, and the effects get stronger with regular practice.</p></li><li><p>The app normally comes with a 7 day trial, but with the link above you'll get a whole month. This is enough to get through the Introductory Course. When the month ends, they'll ask you to pay if you want to continue using it (or, just as with TNF, you can ask for a free subscription and they'll give it to you, no questions asked). The app won't take any money from you until they've asked.</p></li></ul><p>One last thing before we start this. One of the reasons I've personally found Waking Up to work so well for me (and others I've talked to have shared the same) is that it really has the ability to completely transform how your brain works. This is because it begins to frame the issue of consciousness, where thoughts come from, and the power they have over us, in a way that lead to you re-examine how your brain perceives everything. That's the "waking up" Sam Harris is talking about. The benefit to this shift in worldview is nothing short of momentous.</p><p>But it's not something that most people will achieve in just a month. The 28 day course will start to touch on some things that seem a little out of reach out first. But with time, practice and guidance it'll start to open up. So a big piece of advice for those of you who are taking part is to enjoy the next 28 days, not to force anything, and simply try to find 10 minutes a day to look inward.</p><p>When you're done, come share how it's going in the community. We can ask each other these big old questions, and hopefully figure it all out together.</p><p>Excited to have you along for the ride.</p>

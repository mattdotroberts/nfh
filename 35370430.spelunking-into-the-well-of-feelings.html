I don‚Äôt write this newsletter on my own.</p><p>It‚Äôs my name plastered all over it. But someone should be credited as co-author on these posts.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/holasejal/?hl=en">My wife.</a>&nbsp;She's constantly sending me a stream of stuff: videos, quotes, articles and podcasts that she thinks are interesting. And because her taste is so üî•, I'm always inspired.</p><p>This week she sent a podcast she thought I‚Äôd like: Devendra Banhart (big tick) was talking about a book he‚Äôs found helpful during the pandemic (bigger tick) that was a modern retelling of ancient Buddhist teachings (OK, sold). </p><p>On this episode of On Being (a podcast I hadn‚Äôt come across before but am already obsessed with)&nbsp;<a href="https://onbeing.org/programs/devendra-banhart-when-things-fall-apart/">Devendra and Krista Tippett shared their favourite passages from "When Things Fall Apart"</a> a book by Pema Ch√∂dr√∂n about finding strength during times of chaos.</p><p>My son hasn't been sleeping great lately. So I listened whilst lying down on a rollout mattress on the floor of his room, helping his separation anxiety whilst trying to wind down at the end of the crazy day. The podcast had the opposite effect: I was hooked, wired in, rewinding over and over so I didn't miss a beat.</p><blockquote><p><em>"Awakening is frequently described as a journey to the top of a mountain. We leave our attachments and our worldliness behind and slowly make our way to the top. The only problem with this metaphor is that we leave all the others behind ‚Äî our drunken brother, our schizophrenic sister, our tormented animals and friends. Their suffering continues, unrelieved by our personal escape. In the process of discovering "bodhichitta" (a noble or awakened heart), the journey goes down, not up. Instead of transcending the suffering of all creatures, we move toward the turbulence and doubt. We jump into it. We slide into it. We tiptoe into it. At our own pace, without speed or aggression, we move down and down and down. With us move millions of others, our companions in awakening from fear. At the bottom we discover water. Right down there in the thick of things, we discover the love that will not die.‚Äù</em>&nbsp;<br><strong>Pema Ch√∂dr√∂n, When Things Fall Apart</strong></p></blockquote><p>Why are we so obsessed with individual achievement? We equate success with elevation: ‚Äúclimbing the ladder‚Äù, ‚Äúscaling my Everest‚Äù, ‚Äúbeing on top of the world‚Äù.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/the-3-monumental-shifts-transforming">Fatherhood is changing you</a>, but if take a step back, you see it's changing all of us. Together. And what if a group of dads reading a newsletter could be helping to change each other? What if satisfaction in life could be found not by ascending heights on our own, but by heading down deeper with others?</p><h2>I see a darkness</h2><p>Growing up, boys are introduced to The Well of Feelings at an early age. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs dangerous,‚Äù they‚Äôre told. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look down there. Stop crying. Don't get emotional.‚Äù</p><p>So they learn to stay away from the well. They stick a big warning sign next to it:&nbsp;<strong>BEWARE. STAY OUT</strong>. They nail it closed with old wooden planks, and avoid it at all costs. They grow older. Their fear of what might be in there solidifies. Maybe they saw other boys get bullied for playing near it: playing with a baby doll, talking about feelings, crying in the playground. Teased for ‚Äúbeing like a girl.‚Äù</p><p>And then, you find yourself with a kid. Maybe more than one. Back to the well you go. Face to face with these feelings. It‚Äôs unavoidable: these tiny humans bring you cautiously back, wondering what was down there all along, carefully prying the nails out of the old boards that kept you out‚Äîor that kept something else in. And you realise, it might not be so scary after all. In fact, it‚Äôs quite beautiful ...</p><blockquote><p><em>"Into it disappeared plot and space, what was left was emotion, and it was stark, you were looking straight into the essence of human existence, the very nucleus of life, and thus you found yourself in a place where it no longer mattered what was actually happening."</em>&nbsp;<br><strong>Karl Ove Knausgaard, A Man in Love.</strong></p></blockquote><p>We're conditioned to look at fatherhood as something that has to compete with our career and passions. Choose success in your job, or chose to be a great dad. Either/or. Because you can‚Äôt have both. If you want to climb the ladder, there will be late nights, early mornings, missed bedtimes and busy weekends. Even at a place like Google‚Äîsupposedly one of the most forward-thinking companies for working parents‚ÄîI was pulled aside by a manager and chastised for ‚Äúleaving early too often" to be home for bathtime. We‚Äôre force fed the success stories childless men who get up at 5am and do an hour of emails, 45 minutes of Wim Hof breathwork and then 90 minutes on the Peloton. And if you‚Äôve got kids, forget about it. Therefore forget about success. It‚Äôs over.</p><p>So fatherhood begins to look like a weakness. A loss of your killer edge. Something that brings you further from ‚Äúthe top‚Äù (again with the elevation!) But the Well of Feelings changes all of that. Because when you head down there, it doesn't take away. It's additive. As you go deeper down that well, You learn what's down there. You conquer the fear you had, and free the hold it had over you. You learn more about yourself than you've ever known, When you finally get down there, it's a real Bruce Wayne moment. Because it's not a well. Down below there‚Äôs a Batcave, a subterranean HQ filled with very cool shit that can bring a new perspective to every aspect of your life. Empathy. Tenderness. Emotion. So much power that you can put back into your career and passions: how you create, how you communicate, how you understand. Your ability to connect with others can becomes your superpower.</p><p>Listening to the&nbsp;<a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0C5UNl3NoVlmcRAYGBHjIh?si=yokznXOEStKsd65K7OrtEQ">podcast</a>&nbsp;(which, if it isn't blazingly obvious by now, I highly recommend), it wasn't lost on me that Bodhi, my son's name, is the key part of the awakened heart. I can see a direct line that runs from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/when-fatherhood-doesnt-go-to-plan">my experience learning to love him</a>&nbsp;to me sitting writing this today. For me, having a son brought me back to the well in a way that having a daughter never did. It made me realise the work I needed to do to make sure he wasn‚Äôt afraid of what lies beneath, and the power I could take from what I found down there.</p><p>Devendra isn't a father. But in choosing this passage, he shows an innate understanding of how fatherhood leads to an outpouring of empathy:</p><blockquote><p><em>‚ÄúThe father of a two-year-old talks about turning on the television and unexpectedly seeing the bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City. He watched as the firemen carried the limp and bloody bodies of toddlers from the ruins of the day-care center on the building‚Äôs first floor. He says that in the past he was able to distance himself from other people‚Äôs suffering. But since he‚Äôs become a father, things have changed. He feels as if each of those children were his child. He feels the grief of all the parents as his own grief. This kinship with the suffering of others, this inability to continue to regard it from afar, is the discovery of our soft spot, the discovery of bodhichitta."<br></em><strong>Pema Ch√∂dr√∂n, When Things Fall Apart</strong></p></blockquote><p>As we move toward the discovery of our soft spot, together, we must remember: it won‚Äôt always be easy. But there will be no journey more rewarding.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/spelunking-into-the-well-of-feelings/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/spelunking-into-the-well-of-feelings/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>3 things to read this week</h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/04/05/us/coronavirus-pandemic.html">"Who We Are Now"</a>&nbsp;from the New York Times explored life after the pandemic, and all the ways that we've changed:&nbsp;<em>"Who am I?

I learnt some breathing techniques through an online yoga course my employer provides and that was so, so useful. Take a breath. Think about the situation, the outcomes and do the best you can. I still get stressed, but I try spot the triggers, be it that rising feeling in my stomach or rush of blood to the head, and go straight into my breathing...it makes such a difference." </em><strong>Chris</strong></p></li></ul><div><hr></div><h2>Say Hello</h2><p><em>Follow The New Fatherhood on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.twitter.com/thenewfathrhood">Twitter</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.instagram.com/newfatherhood">Instagram</a>.&nbsp;Send me&nbsp;links, comments, questions, and feedback.

It’s a little reductive, sure. It’s obviously more than five people. And the things you watch, the books you read, and the places you visit can influence you just as much, and provide a higher chance of driving the type of <a href="https://www.solutiontree.com/blog/second-order-change/">second-order change</a> that creates a lasting effect.</p><p>But there’s still a lot of truth there. It’s simplicity gives it weight. And it lends itself to your experience as a parent too: <strong>what if, as a father, you’re the sum of the five dads you spend the most time with?</strong></p><p>Who’d be in your handful of padres? And what type of a father are you becoming alongside them? Are they a positive influence on your parenting perspective? Do they lead by example, rejoicing in the role a father can play? Are they raising the bar, as you help each other uncover the opportunities for joy, contemplation and purpose that can come through having kids? </p><p>Or are they doing the opposite? Does an evening spent with them leave you more exhausted than when you started? Are they constantly complaining about their job, their partner, their kids, how terrible life is? Are their visions of fatherhood, and the actions they take as dads, in conflict with the type of parent you want to be?</p><p><em>Huge caveat: there’s a lot of heavy shit going around at the moment. It’s been a rough two years. And I’m not saying that you should cut out those dads in your life having a hard time.

They’re my fatherhood advisory board, my dad support group. It’s like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k3ABfmCr2I">Council of Elrond</a>, only with fewer seats, more rings, and better beards. Most of what you read here starts with them: we’re all winging it, but working it our together; figuring out the types of dads we want to be whilst grappling with the model we inherited; kicking the tyres on different approaches to raising kids; trying to figure out the right way forward in our careers and level of importance (or not) that work contributes to the feeling of a life well lived.</p><p>We need to get into the habit of thinking about fatherhood the way we think about our careers—finding ways to get better at what is the most important job we’ll ever do, to partake in meaningful “training” to help us identify and improve on our weaknesses, to seek out mentors that have been through it all before and can offer the right advice, at the right time. </p><p>This will all be made easier by having a group of dads who you can talk to about these things, who give you permission to move beyond the banter—that surface level yakking about football, beers, meme stocks, Netflix shows—to a place where you can  <a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/dig-in-?r=7kd">dig towards the bigger issues we’re all wrestling with</a>, all too often on our own.</p><p>Don’t have those five dads in your life?

It’s the barrage of research, long-form articles, and personal essays finally breaking down the dam, washing away long-held stigmas around drug use, and getting the wider world to realise how much these misaligned medicines can help people. The latest contribution comes from the gray lady herself, exploring couples who have been experimenting with therapeutic use of MDMA to “produce feelings of empathy, trust and compassion [...] in an effort to help them reconnect, improve communication and have better sex.” Expect to see much more on this topic in 2022.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.romper.com/valentines-day-sex-issue">“The Valentines Day Sex Issue”</a>&nbsp;from Romper + Fatherly.</strong>&nbsp;Coming two days late, this bumper issue of articles for parents who are exhausted but “also, apparently quite horny” celebrates “your horniness as a beacon of hope, your dedication to getting off a daily reminder that no matter how tired, touched out, frustrated, and stretched thin you are, you haven’t given up or shut down.”</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theinevitable.rip/">“The Inevitable”</a></strong> is a freshly launched publication about death, “offering unexpected perspectives on it, useful tactics for dealing with it, and new ways of thinking about everything that leads up to it.” A very good friend who helped midwife TNF into the world is part of the crew behind this. Instant sign-up to their newsletter, can’t wait to hear more from them.</p></li></ol><div><hr></div><h2>Good Dadvice</h2><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/Froggenthusias1/status/1490752695044554756&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;Minecraft proves that abolishing child labour was a mistake.

It’s one of the most fascinating portrayals of fatherhood I’ve seen in years, and was my favourite film of 2020.

The opening 5 minutes (up above) is about as good an explainer video on “how coffee works” that your kids will ever see. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=malIdqAwXdY">But the second half, when one character imbibes more than they can handle</a> might be a bit too much for younger kids … and even some adults of a milder disposition.

I don’t recommend a 2 hour discussion lightly, but it was excellent brain food and, at the very least, helped me crack the structure of an essay that should be in your inbox later this week.</p><div><hr></div><h2>And, Finally, The Most Ambitious Crossover Event In History</h2><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8156fe22-60f2-4d06-b493-e1a351f89732_2432x1430.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8156fe22-60f2-4d06-b493-e1a351f89732_2432x1430.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8156fe22-60f2-4d06-b493-e1a351f89732_2432x1430.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8156fe22-60f2-4d06-b493-e1a351f89732_2432x1430.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8156fe22-60f2-4d06-b493-e1a351f89732_2432x1430.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8156fe22-60f2-4d06-b493-e1a351f89732_2432x1430.png" width="1456" height="856" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8156fe22-60f2-4d06-b493-e1a351f89732_2432x1430.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:856,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:4697529,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8156fe22-60f2-4d06-b493-e1a351f89732_2432x1430.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8156fe22-60f2-4d06-b493-e1a351f89732_2432x1430.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8156fe22-60f2-4d06-b493-e1a351f89732_2432x1430.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8156fe22-60f2-4d06-b493-e1a351f89732_2432x1430.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Ted Lasso’s Brett Goldenstein—better known as the thinly-veiled Roy Keane-a-like Roy Kent—<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CaApzhWsDan/">will soon star in an episode of Sesame Street</a>.

<p>Holy shit. We’re halfway through the year.</p><p>(That means many things. One of which is that I’ve been doing *<strong>this thing</strong>* for 6 months already.)</p><p>I first asked this question in <a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/how-are-you-no-but-how-are-you-really/comments">February</a>, and then again in <a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/open-thread-how-are-you-feeling/comments">April</a>.  And here we are, July already.</p><p>So, let’s go:&nbsp;<strong>“How are you feeling today?”&nbsp;</strong>Pick a number 1-10, then tell us why.</p><p>For those of you new to this: we don’t do any of that “oh yeah, I’m fine, you know” nonsense here.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re feeling down, let us know, we can share the weight. And if you’re feeling great, tell us why and we can maybe get a sweet hit of that serotonin too.</p><p>Hit the button. Tell us how you feel. Then enjoy the weekend.</p>

<p>It’s Friday. Even if it doesn’t always feel like it, that has to still mean something right? <br></p><p>One thing I love about the weekend is Saturday mornings—it’s cartoon time at our house. When we were kids, it was the only time you could guarantee they’d be on TV: no Netflix, YouTube or CBeebies, just plain old 4 channel linear programming.<br></p><p>Kids today eh? They’ll never know the struggle. Today I want to know: <strong>what are you watching with your kids this weekend?</strong></p>

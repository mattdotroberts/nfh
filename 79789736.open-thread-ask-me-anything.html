<p>Happy Friday, to all those who celebrate. </p><p>I’ve seen a few Substacks try this, so thought we might give it a go. Today, and over this weekend, I’ll drop in and out of this thread and answer any questions you might have. </p><p>Feel free to ask about fatherhood, career/work, self-care, mental health, living in a new country, working as an independent, writing on Substack, or <a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/archive/top?sort=top">anything I’ve written about</a> … nothing is off limits.</p><p>I’m not one to hold back and will answer as honestly as you’ve come to expect. To allow a more frank discussion, <strong>I’m going to limit the Q&amp;A to paid subscribers only</strong>, which now includes all the folks who donated towards the TNF Therapy Fund this month. We’re currently able to cover six dads, and edging towards a seventh, so if you were waiting for another nudge, <a href="http://thenewfatherhood.org/subscribe">this is your moment</a>.</p><p>For free subscribers, thank you for sticking around, we’ll be back to a regular open thread next Friday.</p><div class="paywall-jump"></div><p>Everyone else, ask away. </p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/open-thread-ask-me-anything/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/open-thread-ask-me-anything/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p></p>

Being woken by a 2 year old screaming <em><strong>“SPIDERRRRRMAAAAAAAAAN”</strong></em> on Sunday morning at 6:15am is one, clearly. But top of the list, numero uno, the ultimate time I wish I didn’t have to look after a tiny human? It’s when I’m sick. </p><p>Oooooooof. Being sick with kids is tough. You're still required to do everything a non-sick parent does—cooking, cleaning, school runs, bedtimes—but whilst <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxbfMuv_7UA">the Battle of the Blackwater</a> is raging inside your body. It’s playing Parenting Simulator, on Extra Hard, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSCy4Bc0uMU">with the Rock Band guitar</a> for a controller—every waking movement wading through a vat of syrup with concrete shoes.</p><p>It’s impossible not to think back to <em>the before times</em>, being under the weather without children. With hindsight, it was bliss: grab a duvet, crash onto the sofa, stick something on the TV and work your way through a mountain of hot Lemsip and Halls Soothers.</p><p>Long-term sickness is something we all hope to avoid, and I can’t begin to comprehend the trials that people face when parenting with a chronic illness. But even the short-term bouts, the bumps on the road that come this time of year, are gruelling. You're often not the only sick one—your kids almost certainly brought it into the house to begin with—so you're juggling their grumpiness and broken sleep with your own: waking up at 3am with snot cascading down your face dealing with a crying child who has woken up with the same issue; trying to tame an uncontrollable coughing fit as you're putting the baby to bed; or a blocked nose leading to a night of snoring that makes you partner wonder whether “til death do us part” really is as binding as they make it sound. </p><p>Speaking of partners: when you’re not doing great, they’ll help you carry the weight, if they're not coming down with it too (thank you to mine, who continues to do a magnificent job looking after us all). If you have grandparents nearby, they can help too, but it's tougher than ever with Covid an ever-present (and currently increasing) threat.</p><p>On the "C word": I’ve been feeling terrible for two weeks. But if I'm completely honest, I haven't been what I’d call “fighting fit” <a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/covid-positive">since I got Covid back in July</a>. My defences have taken a battering, I'm more prone to getting sick, and I'm slower than usual—often in body and sometimes in mind. I feel like I'm getting better, and then I'm not. The Dutch have a saying that "sickness comes on horseback, but departs on foot.” I can’t help but wish this episode would order an Uber and fuck the fuck off. I was talking to a friend, a little older than me, about this strange back pain that won’t shift since July. "Oh yeah,” he said, “I've had that for about 10 years now." At what age does “getting sick” and plain old “getting old” become the same thing? I hope the answer isn't 38.</p><p>It's all too easy to beat ourselves up for falling short of the idealised father we want to be. But when life gives you lemons, you don't always have to make lemonade—sometimes you just need to squeeze 'em into a cup, mix in a little ginger and honey, pour on the hot water and give yourself a break. This week's newsletter is for those of us who aren't feeling 100%—no deeper meaning, no sub-text to parse, nothing to ponder—just 600 words, in lieu of a hug, from one sick parent to another: you're doing great, don’t be too hard on yourself, and let Grandpa Netflix look after them for a while.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/when-you-wish-upon-a-child-free-star/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/when-you-wish-upon-a-child-free-star/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>3 things to read this week</h2><ul><li><p>A few weeks ago I wrote about <a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/the-one-word-that-will-transform">the power of saying no</a>.

Two great lines, amongst many: <em>"Employers today demand 24/7 access to your mind and soul and claim to be “like family,” which is accurate in the darkest sense"</em> and "<em>The Corrections&nbsp;holds up, a 2001 hit that bangs as hard as&nbsp;Is This It."</em></p></li></ul><div><hr></div><h2>🎄&nbsp;The New Fatherhood gets festive 🎄</h2><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F57168395-474b-42e6-8ccf-0496e61ea8f6_480x262.gif"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F57168395-474b-42e6-8ccf-0496e61ea8f6_480x262.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F57168395-474b-42e6-8ccf-0496e61ea8f6_480x262.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F57168395-474b-42e6-8ccf-0496e61ea8f6_480x262.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F57168395-474b-42e6-8ccf-0496e61ea8f6_480x262.gif 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/57168395-474b-42e6-8ccf-0496e61ea8f6_480x262.gif" width="480" height="262" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/57168395-474b-42e6-8ccf-0496e61ea8f6_480x262.gif&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:262,&quot;width&quot;:480,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;https://media.giphy.com/media/LBAv3HJDl2WwU/giphy.gif&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="https://media.giphy.com/media/LBAv3HJDl2WwU/giphy.gif" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/LBAv3HJDl2WwU/giphy.gif" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F57168395-474b-42e6-8ccf-0496e61ea8f6_480x262.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F57168395-474b-42e6-8ccf-0496e61ea8f6_480x262.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F57168395-474b-42e6-8ccf-0496e61ea8f6_480x262.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F57168395-474b-42e6-8ccf-0496e61ea8f6_480x262.gif 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>I've had a few people get in touch to ask about <strong>gifting subscriptions for Christmas</strong>.

It took me 2 or 3 episodes to get into it. Quite different from the books but I really enjoyed it in the end. The first two seasons of "Babylon Berlin" are superb. If you like history I recommend pairing it with the book "The Coming of the Third Reich" by Richard J Evans."</em> <strong>Kyle</strong></p></li><li><p><em>"Slowly watching S3 of Succession. For my revenge bedtime procrastination, I’ve somewhat gotten through S4 and most of S5 of The Wire. Season 5 is better than I remember it, and feels fresh cos it’s the only season I haven’t watched to death endlessly."</em> <strong>Ivor</strong></p></li><li><p>"<em>Daughter was born on Tuesday so may not be watching anything too soon. Looking forward to Cowboy Bebop and Hawkeye once we're a little more settled."</em> <strong>Thomas</strong></p></li></ul><div><hr></div><h2>Say Hello</h2><p><em>How did you like this week’s issue?

<p>Spring is here. A friend told me that because of the loosened lockdown rules in the UK, they’re now allowed to sit in the back garden—and drink—with five other people.</p><p>And thankfully, that number doesn’t include primary caregivers (so long as they’re working.) So she’s booked a babysitter for tomorrow afternoon, and they’re going to sit drinking rosé in the garden with friends whilst the kids are being looked after. What a great idea. I’m all for it—these little moments of joy that you carve out however you can. </p><p>As The New Fatherhood grows, I see in the comments and my inbox that that we’ve got the start of a wonderful group of people here. <strong>So this weekend, I’d love it if you could hit the button below, introduce yourself, where in the world you are, a little bit about your family, and anything else you want to share. </strong>Can’t wait to hear more about you all.</p>

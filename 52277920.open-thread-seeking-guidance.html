<p>I’ve been on the hunt for advice this week—seeking it out, staying open to what the world might be trying to tell me—while attempting to unlock creative roadblocks in work, with TNF, and elsewhere.</p><p>Wanted to share four creators and resources I’ve been finding useful over the week:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoOae5nYA7VqaXzerajD0lg">Ali Abdall’s YouTube Channel</a>. Ali is a former doctor and now professional YouTuber. I’ve found a lot of actionable insight from his videos as I try to be more intentional about where I put my focus at work and on this newsletter. He touches on productivity, book recommendations for personal growth, investment advice and more. Ignore the clickbait titles, stay for the solid advice.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://austinkleon.substack.com/">Austin Kleon’s newsletter</a> and his books. In particular, I’ve been going deep on everything linked in a recent issue on <a href="https://austinkleon.substack.com/p/how-i-prepare-for-an-interview?s=r">how to interview better</a>. Last week I spoke to Daniel Pink about his new book <a href="https://geni.us/htqjqH">The Power of Regret</a>, and what parents might learn by being more in touch with their regrets. I have quickly realised interviewing is a skill I need to work on, especially as I plan a more regular cadence of chats with interesting dads.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://ckarchive.com/b/e5uph7hx8ldr">This recent Oliver Burkeman essay</a> on “leaning into the cringe” which had totally changed how I’m reading <a href="https://geni.us/MypvI">two</a> <a href="https://geni.us/P5knuA6">books</a> recently put on my radar. I was feeling a little uncomfortable with some of the words and topics in both, and Burkeman’s essay helped me move past that mental blockade.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://yungpueblo.com/">Yung Pueblo’s</a> books and his newsletter. I just finished <a href="https://geni.us/8hdGyX">Clarity &amp; Connection</a> (his second), and my copy is covered in index tabs and scribbled marginalia. A perfect combination to a regular mindfulness and meditation habit.</p></li></ul><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1b2d264-5a46-4851-91a7-7d077f036c24"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1b2d264-5a46-4851-91a7-7d077f036c24 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1b2d264-5a46-4851-91a7-7d077f036c24 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1b2d264-5a46-4851-91a7-7d077f036c24 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1b2d264-5a46-4851-91a7-7d077f036c24 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e1b2d264-5a46-4851-91a7-7d077f036c24" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e1b2d264-5a46-4851-91a7-7d077f036c24&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1510466,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/heic&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1b2d264-5a46-4851-91a7-7d077f036c24 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1b2d264-5a46-4851-91a7-7d077f036c24 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1b2d264-5a46-4851-91a7-7d077f036c24 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1b2d264-5a46-4851-91a7-7d077f036c24 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Vinyl records, model’s own.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Two other big sources of guidance for me:</p><ol><li><p>The folks who read this newsletter, comment on these threads, and join the weekly TNF summits. I had the opportunity to talk with half a dozen of you on Tuesday and it dismantled a gargantuan mental obstruction on an upcoming  series of essays. And we had a lot of fun on the way. Like a friend told me this week, getting over a bout of creative block is like unclogging an old tap—a load of dark, useless gunk comes out first, but when the water starts running clear, it’s a delight.</p></li><li><p>Those folks in my life known to me, but probably not to you: friends, co-conspirators, and confidants who I’ve spent the last 48 hours talking to and learning from. Thank you for sharing your time and expertise with me this week, and always. </p></li></ol><p>Enough about me. <strong>What writers, podcasters, YouTubers, or other creators do you find yourself looking to for advice and guidance</strong>? What kinds of things are they helping you with? <strong>Any books that you keep coming back to when you get stuck?</strong> Or people in your life who are go-to for helping you figure things out?</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/open-thread-seeking-guidance/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}"><a class="button primary button-wrapper" href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/open-thread-seeking-guidance/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p>Happy Easter weekend to all who celebrate.

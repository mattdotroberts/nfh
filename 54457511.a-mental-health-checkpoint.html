Something happens. You think "I'm pissed off." Then, in an instant, you become that thought. You’re angry. You lose control. But with meditation, it's like that TV trope where a character's soul temporarily leaves their body. They look at their physical form and think "what the hell am I doing?" This is a skill that once you develop, you'll never see the world in the same way again. To be able to take a step back from the emotions that start to flood your nervous system and pre-empt the fight or flight response. You don't cast these feelings away: you witness them, honour them, but then act in accordance to what you actually want to do, not just what your programming is dictating. As Dan Harris says "You can still get angry sometimes. But not as often as you might think you need to."</p></blockquote><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:37658706,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/one-daily-habit-to-make-fatherhood&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:255387,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;The New Fatherhood&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0ee5b91e-2d90-40e0-8724-2137063a1e0f_1280x1280.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;One daily habit to make fatherhood easier&quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;I want you to think about something that’s bothering you.

To step back from the hamster wheel of stimulus / reaction / response. You develop the ability to see these patterns from another perspective—feelings that are occurring, but not overwhelming you—and begin to take a step back, to observe them, and make decisions based on the father you want to be, not just driven by whatever emotion is at the wheel at that moment. You learn to look at your feelings uncritically: not to beat yourself up for losing your rag, but to dig deeper into why that same thing might be causing it to happen consistently. To lean into the spikiness, and to see what you can learn from it.”</p></blockquote><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:36284327,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/its-not-what-you-look-at-that-matters&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:255387,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;The New Fatherhood&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0ee5b91e-2d90-40e0-8724-2137063a1e0f_1280x1280.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;It's not what you look at that matters; it's what you see.&quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;The New Fatherhood explores the existential questions facing modern fathers, bringing together the diverse community of forward-thinking dads who are asking them.

Even at a place like Google—supposedly one of the most forward-thinking companies for working parents—I was pulled aside by a manager and chastised for “leaving early too often" to be home for bathtime. We’re force fed the success stories childless men who get up at 5am and do an hour of emails, 45 minutes of Wim Hof breathwork and then 90 minutes on the Peloton.

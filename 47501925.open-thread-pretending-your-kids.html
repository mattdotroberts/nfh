<p>It’s been a week of SURVIVING, not THRIVING here at TNF HQ. </p><p>We’ve had our youngest off school, his class closed due to another outbreak. </p><p>Someone’s class is always locked down. Even when it isn’t. As we move back into a world of “going out and meeting people”, there’s been a resurgence of the oldest trick in the book: <strong>faking your child’s illness (or class lockdown) to get out of previously made plans.</strong></p><p>I’ve done this in the past. And I’ll almost certainly do it again in the future. I don’t always feel great about it. But it’s easier—and more believable—than ever.  </p><p>Today I want to know: What’s your stance? Do you partake? Or are the fear and guilt too much? Is the idea of it abhorrent? Or is it simply a lesser-discussed perk of parenting? </p><p>Should I have kept this quiet, rather than ratting us out? </p><p>Hit the comment button, let’s talk.</p>

<blockquote><p>"When considering a new project or opportunity, one of the first questions to ask is <em>“How do I want to spend my days?”</em> Many opportunities seem exciting but actually give you less of the life you want." <br><strong>—James Clear</strong></p></blockquote><p>I've been banging on about it for weeks: <a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/the-one-word-that-will-transform">the importance of saying </a><em><strong><a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/the-one-word-that-will-transform">No</a></strong></em>. So why was it so hard to follow my own advice?</p><p>A few weeks ago I was asked to become a co-founder. A startup working on a big, bold idea. Something with the potential to help a lot of people, and the planet. Startups are obsessed with "making a dent in the universe", the Jobs-ism <a href="https://solvenext.com/blog/steve-jobs-dent-in-the-universethe-shocking-truth-revealed">first reported in a 1985 issue of Playboy.</a> But us humans? We've made too many dents already.</p><p>This idea had the potential to <strong>fix</strong> some of those dents. So I said yes.</p><p>But I hadn’t considered the crater it would leave in the world I’d created.</p><div class="paywall-jump"></div><p>It came through a new friend in the city. A best friend of a best friend: can a recommendation come any higher? We'd met a few times and hit it off. We didn't talk about work for a while—one of my favourite things about living in Barcelona—but when we did, on maybe our sixth “man date”, he told me he was celebrating handing in his machine learning thesis, and looking to turn his research project into a startup.</p><p>I pointed out a few issues he would face, based on things I’d worked on. He was surprised at my immediate understanding of problems he’d been mulling over for months. So after talking to his co-founder they invited me to join them. I was reluctant. I have a family—they didn't. I told them about my current life stage, <a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/you-are-not-your-job">my career journey</a>, the fact I'm done killing myself for a company, even if it was my own. They understood it all. And still wanted me to be part of it.</p><p>But the warning signs were there. The idea wasn't completely original (is anything?) with no shortage of companies who have tried it. "Google wasn't the first search engine," I reminded myself. But it was when we started talking about exit strategies, fundraising, roles and responsibilities, equity splits, and conflicts in leadership styles that things felt off. These are important subjects that startups face everyday, and discussions best had upfront. But I like my CEO battles  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_(TV_series)">contained to one hour (and one fictional sociopathic family) of TV a week</a>, not popping up as Slack notifications on my phone every 15 minutes.</p><p>My life feels in balance right now. The kids are going to school and they're happy. Thanks to a regular meditation practice, my family and friends, and days filled with work and non-work things I love, I am finding joy in my life on a regular basis—times where I can luxuriate in <a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/time-marches-on-never-ending">the Kairos of life as it is.</a></p><p>This balance was in imminent danger. So, a month in, I had to tell them.</p><p>"I'm exhausted. Already. And we haven't even started. <a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/when-you-wish-upon-a-child-free-star">Being sick didn't help</a>. But even before, it’s been a lot. I can already see things that I hold sacred falling by the wayside: skipping meditation practice, missing school pickups, three days late with my newsletter—ironically about the importance of saying no. Our time is limited. When you’ve got kids? Even more. Every hour on this is an hour taken away from something else I hold dear. I need to step away."</p><p>In 2018 we made a monumental life decision to forge a new path, to close one chapter of our lives and start another. I’d long been exposed to the trade-offs between the professional and personal, having to sacrifice time with loved ones for potential successes at work. I’d finally made it through the looking glass to a place where it all works. So why would I invite that stress and anxiety, even tangentially, back into my life? </p><p>I've spent the last few weeks thinking about payoffs. Not in terms of money, or the idea of a "quick exit", but as a way of measuring the impact of my efforts. Is what I'm working on worth it? Does it matter? In the sustainability space, there’s an acute payoff problem: it's against the natural law of human behaviour to focus on a long-term problem when there are short-term ones staring us down. The problems I deal with today aren't life-threatening—but they're immediate, and happening to people very close to me. Would it be right to choose to <em>"<strong>potentially</strong> help a <strong>lot of people</strong> sometime <strong>the future</strong>"</em> over <em>"<strong>certainly</strong> helping a <strong>smaller number of people </strong>I know <strong>right now?</strong>"</em></p><p>Starting The New Fatherhood—and the discussions I’ve had with many of you over the last year—has opened my eyes to the opportunity we have. The potential to help one another, in a way that I’ve been searching for since I became a dad. It's brought a disparate group of us, spread across the world, together—<a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/how-to-join-the-new-fatherhood-private">a community of dads</a> looking out for one another. It’s the antithesis to the never-ending feed. It's a bunch of like-minded people, in your pocket, whenever you need them. It might be tonight. It might not be for weeks. But they're there. And they're happy to talk—about their ups, their downs, their feelings too. </p><p>These discussions happen in the community, and I want to focus on ways to enable more of them next year. But they also happen in my inbox. Every so often I get an email that stops me in my tracks. This week was a reply to <a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/the-elephant-in-the-room">my essay on the complicated relationship I have with my own father</a>—an emotional outpouring that acted as a mirror to my own childhood experience, bringing back memories that I’d been hiding away for years. It signed off:</p><blockquote><p>"Thank you for creating such an amazing community of emotionally intelligent, sensitive men, who discuss these issues so openly and eloquently. I know you probably have grander plans for growing TNF, but I hope you know how much of an effect you’ve <em>already</em> had on so many of us with all that you’ve done so far."</p></blockquote><p>I stepped away from the startup because I wasn’t prepared to sacrifice what matters to me, and how I spend my days—my family, my passions, this project. A few hours after I walked away, an email arrived in my inbox: <a href="https://on.substack.com/p/substack-grow-fellowship">I'd been invited to become a Substack Fellow</a>, to spend the next two months focused on The New Fatherhood.</p><p>Sometimes the universe has a knack for timing.</p><div><hr></div><p><em>Quick housekeeping note: We’ll be having our inaugural “TNF Coffee Morning” at 3pm CEST / 2pm GMT / 9am EST on Wednesday. <a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/how-to-join-the-new-fatherhood-private">You can RSVP and get the Meet link in Geneva</a>. If you’re in a timezone that makes this time tough, hit reply and let me know. I’m planning on making this a regular monthly meeting, but if anyone has ideas about other things you’d like to do as part of TNF community please let me know!</em></p>

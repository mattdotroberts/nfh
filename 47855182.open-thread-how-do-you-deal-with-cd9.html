<p>Happy Friday! It’s been a busy week here. </p><p>I wound up the <a href="https://on.substack.com/p/substack-grow-fellowship">Substack Fellowship</a>. It’s has been a magnificent experience. I got to know an incredibly talented group of writers, and some of the great folks over at Substack. It forced me to ask some fundamental questions about what The New Fatherhood is—things that I hadn’t really taken the time to consider, and that (I hope) will make this whole thing better for the community of dads that read it.</p><p>And work has been full on. I’ve spent a few late nights at the laptop, and am starting to feel the effects—tense shoulders, frazzled brain, generally not being on top of my game. And I haven’t had the time to do the things that I know will help—dropping good habits, and picking up bad ones. </p><p>So today <strong>I want us to talk about stress, and how we deal with it.</strong> Do you have go-to activities to help you wind down? Do you have healthy ways of relaxing? Or even unhealthy ones?! Do you manage it, try to ignore it, or get angry because of it? </p><p><strong>What are your top tips for decompressing?</strong> </p><p>I’ll share mine in the comments, and I’d love to know what’s working for you.</p>

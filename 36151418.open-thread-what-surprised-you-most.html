<p>This week I’ve been reflecting on my fatherhood journey and thinking about expectation versus  reality. </p><p>I’d love to know: <strong>what surprised you most about fatherhood? </strong>What didn’t you expect? Or what did you think would happen that didn’t? </p><p>It might have been something you felt right away. It could be something you just noticed last week. </p><p>As always, I’ll drop mine in, and looking forward to reading yours. </p><p>Have a great weekend everyone. See you in the comments.</p>

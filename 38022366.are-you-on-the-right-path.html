<p><a href="https://www.thenewfatherhood.org/p/you-are-not-your-job">This week’s issue on work, identity and purpose </a>really hit home for a lot of people. </p><p>I can tell by the number of emails, messages and texts I’ve had—from close friends and the wider world—sharing their own perspectives on where they are, and where they’re heading. </p><p>One friend messaged to say “It’s amazing to think how many people are thinking the exact same thing as you but never say it.”</p><p>So lets say it. Today I want to ask <strong>“do you feel you’re on the right path?” </strong></p><p>Career, family, philosophy, vocation, passions, friends, anything. Are you heading in the right direction? </p><p>I’ll go first.</p>

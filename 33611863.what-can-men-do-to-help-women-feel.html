<p>Hello everyone,</p><p>If you've been&nbsp;<a href="https://time.com/5945656/sarah-everard-police-officer-arrest/">following the news</a>, and listening to conversations online, you'll know that this week has been difficult for many women in the UK, and across the rest of the world.&nbsp;</p><p>It's no surprise that women don't feel safe at night. Every woman has a story of a time she was scared about a man’s intention, action, or reaction, and changed her behaviour because of it. </p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/georgiacobrien/status/1369616386998349824">Women are tired of being blamed</a>: for what they wear, how much they drink, or what method of transport they happen to take home. Because it’s not their fault: it’s almost always men that perpetrate these horrific crimes. </p><p>Of course, not every man is not a murderer or rapist. But that’s not the point. As a gender, we need to step up. <a href="https://twitter.com/kaydobbo/status/1369755480558600194">To talk to our fucking boys</a> (<strong>&lt;-</strong> I highly recommend you take 2 minutes to watch that video.)</p><p>Being totally honest with all of you—I normally write these Friday discussions to make it as easy as possible for you to response. But this isn't an simple question to answer. </p><p>However, it’s important that we start having these conversations in public. So I’ll be adding some comments from women who have shared <strong>what men (and fathers) can do to help women feel safe.</strong></p><p>Please take a look through and share your own thoughts.</p>
